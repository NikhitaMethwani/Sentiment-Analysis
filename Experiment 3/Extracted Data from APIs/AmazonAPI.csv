Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spencer Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.",NEUTRAL,0.054559648,0.000127502,0.943124354
84,"Okay. Spence, I wanted to jump off the M&A question and ask more about capital allocation. You're now more settled in your role than I think it was seven or eight days when we did this interview three months ago, so I'm going to grill you a little bit harder on what you're seeing in your role? What you see as some of the big opportunities for you to tackle in the role as CFO here at the company and how that fits into the broader capital allocation pecking order for the company is trying to accomplish?",NEUTRAL,0.004391811,0.014101355,0.974159241

86,"Yes. I mean, I think something like – returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for S and X is what we anticipate. That’s to the best to my knowledge. We don’t have a crystal ball, but that’s probably our best guess. And sorry, what was the other point?",NEUTRAL,0.085555099,0.10065008,0.552145064
87,"Yeah. I think it's very much aligned with what Reed just mentioned in terms of we just see this incredible growth profile for the business. If we remain focused and execute, it is this giant market that is continuing to shift from linear to on-demand and streaming, so there is a giant market opportunity globally and we want to execute against that, so that ties into your focus in terms of capital allocation and getting smarter and smarter about how we allocate our content dollars and programming mixes in partnering with Ted and the team and continuing to invest in the product and the experience with Greg and his team. So that's what we’re most focused on and then helping to continue to scale our company. ",NEUTRAL,0.459307998,0.001407073,0.532200336
88,"So we intend to be a much larger and much more profitable self-funding company over time, that is the path we're on as we talked about in the letter, we're committed to improve our cash flow profile meaningfully starting in 2020 and then each year thereafter, we'll continue our capital structure similar to how we funded it today to continue on that path, we've talked a lot about that in the past. So to me, it's really about helping the team continue to focus, remain disciplined and build that -- continue to build that muscle of increasing profitability and improving our cash flow profile as we scale.",NEUTRAL,0.133239061,0.01380716,0.840476632

90,"Maybe one more for you following up there, Spence, came in to me in a couple of different ways from a lot of debt investors asking about the expansion of the credit facility, the prior comment about free cash flow improving in '20 over '19, how should investors think about the self-funding component versus the need to continue to tap the debt capital markets as you think of funding the business initiatives inside the company?",NEUTRAL,0.001212879,0.003822818,0.993575513
91,"Yeah. Well, there's no real change in our philosophy or our strategy. So we did expand our revolver recently, we did that just because this business has gotten larger. It was an opportunity for us at the same cost of capital, so it's there for a rainy day, we don't -- we haven't used it, we don't intend to use it, but we thought it was prudent to take advantage of and we'll continue on our path of funding with a high yield market. As you know, we have a very significant cushion between our total equity capitalization and our debt-to-capital ratio. ",NEUTRAL,0.293229133,0.033253737,0.636422575
92,"We also have a high level of interest in those -- in the debt funding markets. It is the most efficient cost of capital for us. We spend a lot of time -- I spend a lot of time, as a new CFO, focused on our liquidity, our payment timing and our cash flow needs and feel very comfortable with this approach to our capital structure. And then, as I said, this is -- it's not a forever in terms of using the debt markets to fund our cash flow needs, because we're moving towards that self-funding path, as I said, starting in 2020.",NEUTRAL,0.261576205,0.059536245,0.62267226

97,"Truly noted. Maybe sticking with content, but I'd love to start with Reed and then go to Ted. Probably, the most important question I get a lot from investors is thinking through the narrative of some of the license content that's been popular on the platform coming off over the next couple of years due to some of the industry players making their own decisions and how you think about aligning your own investments around your own original content to fill in any gaps that happen from a consumption standpoint.",MIXED,0.121133588,0.084343664,0.15413326

And so the idea here is, let's look at job at using the product and other public communication channels to basically let our members know what are those most popular shows so they can watch and then participate in that public conversation.

122,"Greg, sticking with you, another point that was raised again in the letter was around distribution deals. What they're doing for the business is both growing the brand, growing awareness of the service driving subscriber growth, can you give us a little granularity on sort of what you see from these partnerships?

Now that we're three months into 2019, against your broader goals for what you're expecting for the business in 2019, what are the key messages you want to share with investors on how the first three months of the year went?",POSITIVE,0.602025807,0.00046035,0.392373621
126,"Yeah. Again, this is sort of something we've been on a 10 plus year trajectory on in improving the way that we use partners or the way that we leverage those other companies out there to make a connection with members and start with just putting our application on different devices. So, yeah, there was another easy way to find Netflix and to enjoy the service and go from there, but progressively, we found things like bill on behalf of where members could pay for Netflix via their mobile operator charge or their pay TV charge, that was yet another way to make it easier to sign up.",NEUTRAL,0.30802241,0.086228095,0.537982821
127,"And then most recently, we have bundle deals, where it’s sort of the simplest model where you just get Netflix as part of your pay TV offering or your mobile offering. That's a great way for folks to try Netflix very simply, they have easy access to viewing on maybe their set-top box or their mobile phone and allows us to access a subscriber base that might be a little bit slower in signing up directly with us for Netflix. ",NEUTRAL,0.253078341,0.208433688,0.318200618
128,"But I think it's also -- and while these bundled deals are great, they're performing quite well for us and we want to expand them. It's also, I think, relevant to note that, as a fraction through all those channels of the total sign ups we do in any given quarter, in any given year, it's still quite small relative to our organic channel or people signing up with us directly. So we'll see more and more of those and I think it's a nice supplemental channel that accelerates our growth with that.",POSITIVE,0.836300611,0.00518181,0.123554908
129,"Ted, maybe turning to you on the movies front. Obviously, you continue to evolve the strategy on distribution of movies when you think about some of the things having to go into theaters or thinking about different windows yourself for new movie content, how has that strategy evolved? What sort of feedback are you getting from the content creation community? What are you seeing from users and how they want to consume the content?

130,"Well, I think these are all case-by-case. So in a lot of times, I would say that we always have been for consumer choice. If I had my way, I would love to have the movies that are in Netflix to be available in 2,000 theaters at the same time that they're on Netflix. We just don't control the programming of those theaters. So when I say that, what I mean is, if people want to go out and have a good time and pick a great movie and if we're making the great movie, if they don't have the opportunity to see it on a screen, they just -- they don't go out. So the opportunity I think would be to give consumers as much choice as possible, but we can only control what's on Netflix.",POSITIVE,0.349289209,0.214303419,0.256522894
131,"And we are the -- primarily we're releasing in theaters and on Netflix day and date, meaning that by the time they've been there on Netflix at the same time they're in the theaters, we have an opportunity -- we're taking the opportunity to promote the films and generate publicity for the films, release them in select theaters a few weeks early, but in general we want it to be in theaters and on Netflix at the same time, but we can only control Netflix. And I think what it is a lot less to do with the room in which people can consume and all those other things as we have to focus on making great movies. And then anyone who's involved in the ecosystem of presenting movies and watching movies, we'll have to take notice of those films. So that's what we're trying to do, is just make undeniably great movies with undeniably great filmmakers.",POSITIVE,0.536011219,0.016690586,0.392790496

135,"Sure. So, Reed, I'd love to end with you with a little bit of a lighthearted question, but also one that I think allows you to frame a little bit about where you've come from and where you've gone. I noticed in the press at the last week, our competitor said that Netflix may or may not have a brand, it's what they implied. And I figure you probably disagree with the statement that Netflix doesn't have a brand. So I would love to understand your vision of sort of where the Netflix brand has come over the last half decade as you've evolved the company and how do you think about repositioning and evolving the brand to stay at the front of the curve of where the industry's going over the next half decade?",POSITIVE,0.514138997,0.054188326,0.300412327

So, what we're trying not to do is try to in-authentically make a global show, because basically that doesn't work for anybody. So the more authentically local the show is, the better it travels, which we've seen with Kingdom, so fans of K-Drama around the world loved that show and it resonated incredibly well for us in Korea. Similarly, coming up, we have a new season of The Rain coming out this quarter, that is perfectly Swedish. We don't try to make it -- water it down or make it travel any better inorganically and it found that the best way to make global stories is to make them incredibly authentically local.",POSITIVE,0.56015259,0.118048303,0.21911636

But certainly what we are seeing is that mobile is an increasing way for us to attract new subscribers.

We guided at the beginning of the year to increasing our margins by 300 basis points for the full year to 13%. We came in this quarter slightly ahead. Part of this, we're continuing to scale our business in terms of some combination of content and marketing spend, in particular, growing at a slower rate than revenue in this quarter, in particular I think you saw that on the marketing line where we had a lot of both growth and experimentation in marketing last year, which we talked about.",POSITIVE,0.597526729,0.011907319,0.327237487

And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren’t you potentially trying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic. So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn’t do? Or wouldn’t do? And I have a follow up, please.",NEUTRAL,0.083138831,0.297245324,0.479073256

So that in that sense, I think it’s just, it’s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to make sure we don’t have extraneous expenses and we’re just being frugal with capital. If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional operation of the business.

At this point, I think we are doing that. There’s more work to do, and Tesla today is far more efficient operating organization than it was a year ago.

And that this [indiscernible] we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time. We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1. That’s insane. So, I think we need to unwind that. I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.

We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided they are in locations where there is high foot traffic and that are in our target market. So, we actually will continue to add stores in locations are no-brainers. We will close stores in locations where they are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very low such that it does not support the cost of the store and the people in it.

So, we thought a product that’s really just knows the sweet spot, which I think the $39,500 Model 3 is just really nail the sweet spot and raising consumer response accordingly. You can tell by the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn’t have Autopilot and has a software introspection, that kind of thing. It’s like slightly more inconvenience to buy just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So, it’s just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something.

Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal.

396,"Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you.",NEUTRAL,0.228722155,0.042515717,0.615382373
397,"Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter. We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.",NEUTRAL,0.1065671,0.010037091,0.869504392
398,"Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%.",NEUTRAL,0.057119854,0.011060524,0.92457509
399,So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis.,NEGATIVE,0.007774804,0.83742255,0.133659482
400,"So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue.",POSITIVE,0.653333426,0.003272474,0.313565552
401,"So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us.",POSITIVE,0.805494964,0.010307434,0.115257189
402,"For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis.",POSITIVE,0.608220816,0.055656359,0.30667308
403,But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path.

404,So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve.

408,"First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows. The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1. We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.",NEUTRAL,0.03080406,0.003815493,0.962530792
409,"And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration.

414,"Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky.",POSITIVE,0.755001366,0.009476139,0.211513475
415,"On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter. So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two. The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet. We expect significant cost savings to come from this.",NEUTRAL,0.0874395,0.073948927,0.816182017
416,"So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say.",POSITIVE,0.660269797,0.015975432,0.254937172

418,"Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform?",NEGATIVE,0.030181708,0.591835797,0.187574372

420,"Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers.",POSITIVE,0.39876315,0.247509688,0.229514673

424,"On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28. This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes. There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.",NEUTRAL,0.039809372,0.018219046,0.935812175
425,"And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon.",POSITIVE,0.994903088,0.000236695,0.001435685
426,"And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.",NEGATIVE,0.014642986,0.700469434,0.219163015

430,"Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app.",POSITIVE,0.857179224,0.029045325,0.097152762

That shows up in our online stores classification.",NEUTRAL,0.156607717,0.299067765,0.463949859

So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases.

433,"Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted. If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries. Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%. This is due to two factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1. In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.",NEUTRAL,0.040827371,0.070935555,0.871506989

I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way.

In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast.

463,"Yes, this is Sheryl; I’ll take the Stories question. So one of the things we learned is that consumers usually move to new features, to new products, to new places before marketers, and it’s really up to us to help marketers move there quickly. We definitely saw that with mobile, that one of the barriers was convincing marketers that they needed to be with mobile. But then there was a second barrier which was just making it easier for them to do it.

And the supply growth really getting driven by Stories is coming through at lower prices, so that’s one of the factors that factors into the lower growth outlook for the second half. But on the demand side, want to specifically call out several factors that are contributing to ad targeting headwinds. The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR. The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we’ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world.

I mean it’s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed, because there’s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls.

So - and in particular, I think the question is if you're - hopefully, if you're skilled and you've done your job correctly, you come out of any restructuring with a claim and ownership stake or some other type of investment claim on that company so that if and when that company fixes the issues that caused the financial underperformance, you hold on to value that can increase to return your capital and possibly and then some, right?",NEUTRAL,0.01876249,0.335614383,0.496316582

I think that's why you see us as a management team focusing on things that are going to be shareholder friendly, that will continue to produce attractive net investment income and therefore a good, stable dividend performance in that context.

Can you kind of describe the sequential market this - or a function of the asset going on, on nonaccrual and being worked out potentially, helping us think about sort of the risk of second lien in that sense when you see something last quarter that was marked in the 70 range?

725,"Yes. So Jon here. First off, let me give some context. So our loan to Country Fresh is frankly a very small position in the portfolio. It was less than $10 million of invested capital compared to the $1.5 billion of total balance sheet investments. So little context there. But to give you a little color, it's a sponsor-backed company where - that processes and distributes fresh-cut fruits and vegetables to retailers. Our underwriting thesis when we made this loan was really centered on the large scale and national operational footprint of the company that we thought acted as a nice competitive advantage and a barrier to entry for competitors.",NEUTRAL,0.098983012,0.201979697,0.610265374

But regardless, during the course of 2018, certain performance issues started to emerge. Much of it was related to raw material and labor cost issues. But we were pleased that during the course of 2018, the sponsor, which had invested significant capital below our debt, continued to invest additional capital throughout 2018. That being said, we did - if you look at sort of our marks quarter-over-quarter over the course of 2018, we were marking down the position to reflect what we thought was a prudent view of the increased risk of the position.",NEUTRAL,0.133974925,0.133647248,0.45261237
728,"In the first quarter of 2019 - and I guess this kind of gets the heart of your question of, obviously, there was a pretty big move from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in the mark. In the first quarter of 2019, we became aware of some significant liquidity concerns at the company that really prompted both the first lien and second lien lender groups to start focusing on a restructuring. And you were right in asking or suggesting that this happened very quickly. It definitely did happen quite quickly given sort of the updated liquidity situation and frankly some updated information that we got about the company at the end of the fourth - about 2018 results. In the first quarter, we moved quickly with other lenders to focus on restructuring. And so we have marked the position down to reflect kind of a view given the new information that we got during the first quarter. I will say that subsequent to the quarter end, we have now completed a restructuring of the position. And we think that the company, that the position that - the mark that we had at the end of the first quarter, obviously we're still in the midst of the second quarter, so we can't say with any degree of uncertainty as to exactly where the mark on this position will be as we get to the end of the second quarter.

I think we have a point of view that the middle market is a place that nonbank lenders are going to thrive and are needed as fundamental elements of the ecosystem.

739,"Yes. Leslie, it's Brendan here. The only thing I'd add is when you think about those - in the context of capital markets disruption, oftentimes the ""opportunistic transaction"" is stepping into the shoes of a deal that has been perhaps structured aggressively or underwritten in a way that one might not be comfortable with. Structure, in particular, becomes important in the documentation of the loans. And so rather than trying to define the right price to pay for a deal that might not have the attributes that we prefer to have. I think what you saw this quarter was the ability to execute within a market environment where certainty of private credit really comes to the floor, but doing deals that were underwritten in a traditional way, par lending for deals that we've been focusing on for quite some time in the middle market in particular. I would say another attribute oftentimes in those more opportunistic deals as they do tend to be bigger companies, bigger capital structures where deals might be straddling the syndication market. And so our preference continues to be the focus on the heart of the middle market. I think that's what you've seen us do this quarter.",NEUTRAL,0.11942526,0.194008574,0.562394977

741,It's the former. So it's just a matter of mix in terms of the companies that we are originating loans to versus the ones that left the portfolio. It's not been driven by declines in EBITDA of our portfolio companies.,NEUTRAL,0.066153727,0.026286384,0.899442792

744,"Yes. I mean - so yes, although I mean I would - we - I wouldn't necessarily anchor you to that or anybody to that. I mean I think we're making our best guesses as to when that deal is going to close. But certainly, there are a number - it's largely outside of our control. Just to refresh everybody's memory, NTS is a deal that we're - it's a company that's been acquired, and as part of that acquisition, our debt - we'll receive a return for our debt. The deal is contingent as all telecom deals are on getting approval from the FCC to transfer the licenses to operate the telecommunications system that, in this case, NTS owns. And so you're literally waiting for the FCC to finish its review of the transaction and the application to transfer licenses, and the FCC can work on its own timeline, quite frankly. But just based on historical precedent and what we have seen and what our advisers have told us as to what is a reasonable time frame to expect that review to be concluded, we have been projecting sometime around the end of the second quarter. It is definitely possible it could slip into the third quarter, there's no assurances given. But we think - we certainly think we're closer to getting - or hopeful that we're closer to getting that approval today than we were when the transaction was announced late last year.

748,"This is Michael Ramirez on for Mark. I guess just a follow-up on the - I guess the origination question previously. It looks like many of your public BDC peers have characterized this environment as remaining competitive. No big change from last few quarters. You mentioned this morning the overall deal volume has been lower than historical averages. We've both seen that with the data. But your new originations were greater than last year. So our question is what percentage of the deal that came across your desk this quarter did you close on compared to prior quarters? And if we can ask additionally, when you are passing on deals, what are some characteristics that you're trying to avoid? And how has this changed over time?",NEUTRAL,0.02150814,0.047753539,0.911572278
749,"Yes. I'll take a first crack in this multipart question, Jon, so you have some insights here as well. I think, Michael, in any given quarter, it's always hard to sort of define your own origination cadence versus the market. I think the observations that we described are - certainly are consistent, a slowing of market trends overall. But when you look at the size and scale of our platform in the company, we're one player here. In any given quarter, 1 or 2 deals can break one way or another such that your own trends are different than the broader market here. So there's certainly no change with respect to the hit ratio, if you will, of deals that we're closing on relative to the deals that we're seeing. If anything, one thing that you've heard us say consistently is we really try to focus on having a diversity of sources of opportunities coming in. We were successful again this quarter, as Jon described, leveraging our private wealth network where - what we think are, by definition, less competitive financing opportunities. So I think that kind of works on our favor in the context of competitive market environment.",NEUTRAL,0.252811015,0.042483091,0.653969407
750,"Your other question, I think, was around what's typically the nature of why we might lose a transaction in the course of a competitive environment. I think most often, it comes down to the terms that you're willing to offer. Oftentimes, the quantum of debt relative to the companies capable to service that I think becomes a key factor. I'm sure you've heard folks in the market describing, for example, there are concerns about adjusted EBITDA and the adjustments that are made. For us, in our platform, what we try to do is really be quite, quite disciplined around defining for ourselves what is an EBITDA that we can underwrite, and in the context of that number as opposed to a number that might be otherwise marketed to us, provide a solution that we're willing to offer. I would say there is one common scenario where we're not winning transactions because we're not willing to be as aggressive with respect to financing or underwriting an EBITDA that perhaps a different competitor might be.",NEUTRAL,0.024636209,0.431972712,0.444081396
751,"Yes. And just to add onto that a little bit. I mean I think there's - in a sense you can think at an even higher level here. There's really two breaking points in terms of when you are calling your sort of funnel down to what you actually invest in. The first question is really is this a company that you want to finance. And then Brendan's commentary was around, okay, if you determine that something that - is a company that you'd like to finance, what are the reasons why you may choose not to go forward even if you like the underlying company. But the one - the bigger picture I do want to convey is by far, the biggest reason when companies go from the top of the funnel where an opportunity comes in and get to weed it out is because they don't pass sort of our credit metrics. And then if it does pass our kind of - our underwriting standards, then as Brendan was saying, we get into, well, is there a structure that we can get comfortable with that - and oftentimes - or sometimes at least, the reality is that other competitors will offer to do things that we wouldn't be comfortable with. But again, it all starts with fundamentally do we like this business and is it one that we think we're comfortable with and that whittles out the vast majority of the companies that come in at the sort of top of the funnel.",NEUTRAL,0.177856833,0.148615733,0.486585468

I'm sure this question has been asked a few times over last year, so - but what metrics, thresholds do you need to exceed to be comfortable to raise your dividend? Any color on that, that would be helpful.",NEUTRAL,0.13803035,0.003212676,0.83135134
754,"Yes. The over-earnings of the dividend is in the context of the historical portfolio, higher portfolio of yields. As we've transitioned the portfolio in more recent quarters to more first lien investments, you've seen our weighted average yield at cost come down. And we think that the over-earnings of the dividend can certainly continue, but we don't see a point in the context of what we're seeing in the market and our target leverage ratio where we think it makes sense to increase our dividend in terms of the fixed dividend. We do, as I mentioned, have the $1.14 of spillover income. At this point, we think it's advantageous to shareholders to continue to spill that over given where we trade and the cost of raising equity capital versus being able to spill it over for a nominal excise cost.

758,"Yes. We'll take a crack at the pro forma. I think when you look at what we're doing here, effectively today, as of the end of the quarter, what the company reflects is an equity investment in a leveraged entity, and that historically has produced a dividend yield back on that equity investment, which has been attractive. And as we described I think at length, we can effectively now do that on balance sheet. So the pro forma impact will be that we'll basically swap that equity investment. That equity investment will go away off our balance sheet and we'll take back on the balance sheet. Those whole loans that were within that vehicle diversified portfolio of first lien loans, we schedule all those out within our Ks and Qs so you can see those.",NEUTRAL,0.294686526,0.006130099,0.67967546
759,"So the yield on those investments is nominally lower than what has historically been on balance sheet. But of course, we can now finance those assets on balance sheet at the same target leverage, which will end up producing the same type of overall return to the company. And most importantly, when you step back and look at what the new business looks like, there's a simplicity to the balance sheet, which is just a portfolio of whole loans that we believe is attractive to financing providers. So said quite frankly, the notion of financing a leveraged equity, an acquisition in a leveraged vehicle, not that attractive to lots of folks, but with whole loans, especially first lien loans, is quite attractive. So we think certainly over time, that helps lower the cost of financing for our vehicle, which, of course, has a benefit of enhancing the net returns that we can earn for the company.",NEUTRAL,0.25916183,0.077363685,0.597569704

820,"Yeah, a great question, John, and it's something that we talk about obviously routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving Alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had – it's a huge opportunity, we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both.

I didn’t really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don’t want to read too much into it, but can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you’ve pointed out in the past, I think the Street is skeptical of getting to that, given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? ",NEUTRAL,0.076556332,0.149815068,0.711095989
864,"And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill, and there’s a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition, and now with this real estate transaction, that was $57 million I think. So that’s about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren’t aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? ",NEUTRAL,0.040472843,0.062275849,0.87867552
865,"Sure. Yeah, I think as you think about the Restock Kroger plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities.

867,"As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying I would say more cost savings as we’re working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there and becoming a more efficient operator. ",POSITIVE,0.724598706,0.002515827,0.263316959
868,I do think as we’ve shared all the way along and Rodney’s been consistent in his comments that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales.

So we were at $3.1 billion in 2017, down to $3.5 billion. There may be a couple of – they’re certainly not going to be drastic and material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that have happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020.

874,We certainly don’t contemplate as we think about the run rate and the value that we’ll be generating in 2020 the one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create.

875,But the Home Chef certainly isn’t in the $400 million. And the Turkey Hill sale gain certainly isn’t included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are. That’s why we kind of stripped those out from the performance and what which shared is our progress in the year. None of those or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain and that would be if you like filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. ,NEUTRAL,0.004978636,0.144938111,0.8302266

886,"Yes. We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3. The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade. So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant. And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December 31. So, these were all very positive factors. We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model 3. So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries.

Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren’t you potentially trying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic. So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn’t do? Or wouldn’t do? And I have a follow up, please.",NEUTRAL,0.083138786,0.297245383,0.479073197
1021,"Yes. I don’t think raising capital should be substitute for making the company operate more effectively. So that in that sense, I think it’s just, it’s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to make sure we don’t have extraneous expenses and we’re just being frugal with capital. If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional operation of the business.

1066,"Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%.",NEUTRAL,0.05711988,0.011060524,0.92457509

We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis.,NEGATIVE,0.007774804,0.83742255,0.133659437

So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program.

1073,"On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter. So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.

From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world. So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that. And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for capital efficient expansion.

So one of the things we learned is that consumers usually move to new features, to new products, to new places before marketers, and it’s really up to us to help marketers move there quickly. We definitely saw that with mobile, that one of the barriers was convincing marketers that they needed to be with mobile. But then there was a second barrier which was just making it easier for them to do it.

The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR. The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we’ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world.

You mentioned this morning the overall deal volume has been lower than historical averages. We've both seen that with the data. But your new originations were greater than last year.

And then Brendan's commentary was around, okay, if you determine that something that - is a company that you'd like to finance, what are the reasons why you may choose not to go forward even if you like the underlying company. But the one - the bigger picture I do want to convey is by far, the biggest reason when companies go from the top of the funnel where an opportunity comes in and get to weed it out is because they don't pass sort of our credit metrics. And then if it does pass our kind of - our underwriting standards, then as Brendan was saying, we get into, well, is there a structure that we can get comfortable with that - and oftentimes - or sometimes at least, the reality is that other competitors will offer to do things that we wouldn't be comfortable with.

I didn’t really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don’t want to read too much into it, but can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you’ve pointed out in the past, I think the Street is skeptical of getting to that, given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? ",NEUTRAL,0.076556347,0.149815127,0.71109587
1266,"And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill, and there’s a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition, and now with this real estate transaction, that was $57 million I think. So that’s about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren’t aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? ",NEUTRAL,0.040472858,0.062275868,0.878675401
1267,"Sure. Yeah, I think as you think about the Restock Kroger plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities.

1269,"Yeah, so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we’re place lined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion in 2017, down to $3.5 billion. There may be a couple of – they’re certainly not going to be drastic and material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that have happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020.

1272,But the Home Chef certainly isn’t in the $400 million. And the Turkey Hill sale gain certainly isn’t included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are. That’s why we kind of stripped those out from the performance and what which shared is our progress in the year.

The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.

Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%. This is due to two factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1. In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.",NEUTRAL,0.040827382,0.070935555,0.871506989

Structure, in particular, becomes important in the documentation of the loans. And so rather than trying to define the right price to pay for a deal that might not have the attributes that we prefer to have. I think what you saw this quarter was the ability to execute within a market environment where certainty of private credit really comes to the floor, but doing deals that were underwritten in a traditional way, par lending for deals that we've been focusing on for quite some time in the middle market in particular. I would say another attribute oftentimes in those more opportunistic deals as they do tend to be bigger companies, bigger capital structures where deals might be straddling the syndication market.

1399,"Yeah, it's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney. So thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where Alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside.

1402,"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second. Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or reservation list maybe telling you?",NEUTRAL,0.364066303,0.008072193,0.617386758
1403,Thank you. ,POSITIVE,0.921909869,0.006355584,0.067365482
1404,"Yes. We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3. The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade. So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant. And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December 31. So, these were all very positive factors. We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model 3. So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries. Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.",POSITIVE,0.605774939,0.020001555,0.30638054
1405,"Yeah, so certainly as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned, and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth, those two combined would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. ",NEGATIVE,0.016376851,0.739164472,0.184091747
1406,And Alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of gift cards and the other related items. ,NEUTRAL,0.393416822,0.077108778,0.517620027

1408,"Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the core gross margin for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments and the pharmacy, what are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend if you could. Thank you. ",POSITIVE,0.635356426,0.056526028,0.105539009
1409,"Okay, thanks. And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, because it was I think you said packed to the gills. I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada. Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?",NEGATIVE,0.006079447,0.730326593,0.17048654
