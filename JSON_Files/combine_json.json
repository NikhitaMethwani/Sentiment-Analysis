Inc (NASDAQ:","1":"Company Participants","2":"Pierre Ferragu - New Street Research","3":"Well, first of all, obviously on account of tents, like I mean, we like hardcore tents, so I am not like Cub Scout tents, which are fine, but this is actually \u2013 credit goes to Tesla team, because they actually look at how could we do this in Fremont if we had to and we feel like we can actually append building space to the \u2013 to the west side of the building and use a lot of internal space that\u2019s currently used for warehousing in the Fremont factory. And so we believe it actually can be done with minimal disruption to add Model Y to Fremont.","4":"Ryan Brinkman","5":"Thank you.","6":"Operator","7":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.","8":"Pierre Ferragu","9":"Hey, thanks for the call. My first question is really on the Model S and Model X and Elon, you said you are comfortable with the one you see \u2013 based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter is the level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already or are we not there yet? And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 probably hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Is that something that we still see the numbers today in recent weeks or is that behind us? And I have a follow-up on Q2.","10":"Elon Musk","11":"Yes. I mean, I think something like \u2013 returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for S and X is what we anticipate. That\u2019s to the best to my knowledge. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but that\u2019s probably our best guess. And sorry, what was the other point?","12":"Pierre Ferragu","13":"Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","14":"Yes. My question was about like the run-rate of demand you see at the moment, do you still feel like weak demand in the U.S. because of the pull forward in Q4 or do you think demand returned to normal already?","15":"Elon Musk","16":"I think we expect demand to \u2013 we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2. And it might be a little better than normal. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, it\u2019s hard for me to say, but my impression right now is that demand is quite solid, quite strong, yes.","17":"Pierre Ferragu","18":"And then my second question was briefly on...","19":"Elon Musk","20":"Sorry, Zach would like to...","21":"Zachary Kirkhorn","22":"Yes. Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X. We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted. That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2. So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3. It\u2019s already increasing.","23":"Pierre Ferragu","24":"Maynard Um - Macquarie","25":"And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am surprised you don\u2019t \u2013 you just still expect a loss. So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a profit for similar volumes? How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and other things?","26":"Elon Musk","27":"Sure. So quite a bit, but we think if we didn\u2019t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America. And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it\u2019s West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars. But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just \u2013 not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive efforts from Tesla team. So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave. And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?","28":"Zachary Kirkhorn","29":"Yes. No, I think you summarized it well, Elon. Two other things that I would add. One is we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margin. And so that\u2019s part of what we will see in Q2. The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost efficiency of the business without sacrificing growth and that in combination with the efficiencies from unwinding the wave, is where we feel we will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of those pieces are in place.","30":"Pierre Ferragu","31":"Thank you.","32":"Martin Viecha","33":"Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","34":"Operator","35":"Dan Galves - Wolfe Research","36":"Our next question is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","37":"Adam Jonas","38":"Thanks. First question, Elon, a couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is the Autopilot technology and you said something like twice as safe as normal driving, but you seem to be in a really unique position to really collect exobytes of data, you could potentially be externally validated much more rigorously provided the regulatory body or insurance institute to just show how much safer Autopilot is. When could we expect to see Tesla do that, that type of validation that investors could also get a sense of? It seems really, really important for adoption. Thanks. And I have a follow up.","39":"Elon Musk","40":"I think we are just going to continue to report the absolute numbers. I think a point of detail just give those of you our bytes of Tesla that maybe sort of like data mine the situation and then try to turn it positive into negative. So we are just going to keep reporting report. We do give some more detailed information to insurance companies to help with rates. And obviously as we launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that information into the insurance rates. So, we essentially have a substantial price and sort of arbitrage or information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and based on the car and then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they would have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher. So we are just going to keep reporting the numbers at a broad stroke level, which I think is really what matters.","41":"Adam Jonas","42":"Okay, I understand it.","43":"Elon Musk","44":"That\u2019s the safety.","45":"Adam Jonas","46":"Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","47":"Okay. And just as a follow-up, Elon and you kind of alluded a little bit, there is just so much drama around Tesla\u2019s share price and quarterly results. From the outside at least, it looks like a huge distraction. And at the same time, there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital that is incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership. So how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?","48":"Elon Musk","49":"Well, mate, I don\u2019t want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private, but unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed, so...","50":"Adam Jonas","51":"But is it important? I mean, you think the company\u2019s value is maximized being public? Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play the hand you\u2019re dealt?","52":"Elon Musk","53":"Well, I think this feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way. And I think Warren Buffett\u2019s analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your house every day. It\u2019s still the same house.","54":"Adam Jonas","55":"Yes.","56":"Elon Musk","57":"Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray","58":"So, it\u2019s a bit of a distraction at times, but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it.","59":"Adam Jonas","60":"Okay understood. Thanks.","61":"Operator","62":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.","63":"Maynard Um","64":"Hi thanks. In the update letter, you talked about supplier limitations impacting production. Can you just talk about what that was and how long you think that might continue to impact you? And then I have a follow up.","65":"Elon Musk","66":"In Q2, we don\u2019t we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the significant ones that we\u2019re aware of.","67":"Maynard Um","68":"Philippe Houchois - Jefferies","69":"Okay. And I guess there was some concern out there that Model 3 was cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different vehicle classes, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence that proves, disproves this? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","70":"Elon Musk","71":"No, they\u2019re reducing through different market segments. Yes.","72":"Zachary Kirkhorn","73":"And also, not only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S. So, it\u2019s from all the Model 3 trade-ins, Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.","74":"Elon Musk","75":"Yes, for sure. People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.","76":"Martin Viecha","77":"Okay let\u2019s go to the next question please.","78":"Operator","79":"David Tambourino - Goldman Sachs","80":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.","81":"Dan Galves","82":"Hi thanks everybody. A couple of questions. One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments? Is that what you\u2019re, kind of seeing as order flow? I\u2019m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?","83":"Zachary Kirkhorn","84":"Yes, this is Zach. I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that there\u2019s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced. And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it\u2019s starting the average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes. And just under $50,000 ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it\u2019s starting to stabilize there. And we\u2019ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we\u2019re seeing in North America is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].","85":"Dan Galves","86":"That\u2019s really helpful. And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way. So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades. But on Model 3, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is for Model 3, does your current order flow support that? Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?","87":"Elon Musk","88":"I think we\u2019ll I think we\u2019ll be fine. Yes, I don\u2019t think there any major thing required.","89":"Dan Galves","90":"Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer","91":"Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","92":"Operator","93":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.","94":"Toni Sacconaghi","95":"Yes, thank you. Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren\u2019t you potentially trying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic. So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn\u2019t do? Or wouldn\u2019t do? And I have a follow up, please.","96":"Elon Musk","97":"Yes. I don\u2019t think raising capital should be substitute for making the company operate more effectively. So that in that sense, I think it\u2019s just, it\u2019s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to make sure we don\u2019t have extraneous expenses and we\u2019re just being frugal with capital. If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional operation of the business. So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while. At this point, I do think there are it is similar to raising capital. That\u2019s a but this is sort of probably about the right timing, but yes.","98":"Toni Sacconaghi","99":"So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term? And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean growth does eat cash especially in a capital-intensive business. If you really do believe you have a first mover advantage, why wouldn\u2019t you want to push it as quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short term.","100":"Elon Musk","101":"Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","102":"Yes. First of all, I\u2019ll just say that I don\u2019t think capital has been constrained on our growth thus far and the type of those fund in fact, if there was a final constraint on growth would\u2019ve faced capital before now. But I think it is very important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we\u2019re we have the appropriate financial discipline throughout the company and are spending money very efficiently. At this point, I think we are doing that. There\u2019s more work to do, and Tesla today is far more efficient operating organization than it was a year ago. We\u2019ve made dramatic improvements across the board. And so, I think there\u2019s merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.","103":"Zachary Kirkhorn","104":"Just to add to that, the journey we\u2019ve been on for the last 12 to 18 months on being more efficient and how we spend money has really changed the full trends of the company. It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements in operating expenses as well. And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here. So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.","105":"Elon Musk","106":"And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $500 million. So that we want to make sure that we don\u2019t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.","107":"Martin Viecha","108":"Thank you. Now let\u2019s go to the next question please.","109":"Operator","110":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.","111":"Alex Potter","112":"Martin Viecha - Senior Director, Investor Relations","113":"Colin Langan - UBS","114":"Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter. You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward. Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you\u2019re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...","115":"Elon Musk","116":"No, they would actually receive their cars sooner. It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter. And that this [indiscernible] we don\u2019t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time. We literally delivered half of the entire quarter\u2019s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1. That\u2019s insane. So, I think we need to unwind that. I suppose it\u2019s not a great customer experience because we\u2019re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars. And then we then they can do their regular jobs. So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.","117":"Alex Potter","118":"Okay. That makes sense. Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was focused on closing storefronts. A fair amount of noise made around that. And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy. I was just wondering if there\u2019s any update there. If you have that, that would be helpful. Thanks.","119":"Elon Musk","120":"Sure. I think Tesla just sort of I didn\u2019t handle messaging of that well. I mean, that\u2019s amplified by statement taking to an extreme where there was a misunderstanding. We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided they are in locations where there is high foot traffic and that are in our target market. So, we actually will continue to add stores in locations are no-brainers. We will close stores in locations where they are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very low such that it does not support the cost of the store and the people in it. So, I think it\u2019s just common sense. And then all sales online just, means that even if you go into a store, you we would guide you to order the car on your phone. So, source essentially like there like information centers, place you can get a test drive and buy some Tesla merchandise, that kind of thing. But all sales online, doesn\u2019t mean all stores are closed. Just means when you buy a car, you always do it on your phone in the store or at home or anywhere. Orders online doesn\u2019t, meant all stores are closing. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s meant.","121":"Alex Potter","122":"Okay very good. Thanks.","123":"Operator","124":"Operator","125":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.","126":"Philippe Houchois","127":"Hi yes, thank you for taking the questions. I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on the agreement you seem to have reached with FCA on the possibility of selling your CO2 credits to them in Europe and what that means to your potential cash inflow. When that might start occurring? And if there is any chance any of those things are in your Q1 cash position?","128":"Elon Musk","129":"I think it\u2019s a confidential deal with FCA so we and we agreed with FCA not to comment on it publicly so we must abide by that.","130":"Philippe Houchois","131":"And can I ask you a question of coming back to what Adam was saying about the drama that surrounds your unfortunately, why don\u2019t you reduce some of it by disclosing on a monthly basis your deliveries and also maybe disclosing early your greenhouse revenue instead of just reserves so we get right away a better view on some of these details that kind of move the stock.","132":"Elon Musk","133":"I think that would actually be counterproductive because people read too much into what occurred in a month. I mean, even at a quarterly basis, things can be lumpy. And so the more granularity that\u2019s provided on a monthly level, the few would reach all sorts of conclusions that doesn\u2019t makes sense. It\u2019s like literally sales to a particular country, say, overseas are affected by when the ship arrives. And so, if the ship arrives on the 31st of the month or the first of the next month, this will make it look like something dramatic has happened. But actually, the ship was just a day late. So, people read that would increase the drama, not decrease it.","134":"Zachary Kirkhorn","135":"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Tesla Q1 2019 Financial Results and Q&A webcast. My name is Sherry and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may now proceed.","136":"And we\u2019re filling the ship 100% [indiscernible].","137":"Elon Musk","138":"Filling the ship 100% so it\u2019s like it just ends up being lumpy. So, like if you managed if you\u2019ve calculated like GDP of a country to offset the U.S., GDP on Sunday is extremely low, but GDP on a Monday is extremely high. It does not mean nothing has really changed.","139":"Operator","140":"Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tambourino with Goldman Sachs.","141":"David Tambourino","142":"Great. Thanks for taking our questions. First one, on customer deposits, it looks like it\u2019s essentially flat to maybe slightly down. I understand it\u2019s probably some timing with deliveries that could have helped it towards the end of the quarter. But we would have thought it would have increased given the Model Y [indiscernible]. So, our question is what was the initial order intake for the Model Y? And just coming through combing some of your comment earlier, what daily order rate are you seeing right now for the rest of your products?","143":"Elon Musk","144":"I think we don\u2019t want to comment on the granularity of deposits. Again, people read too much into this. We\u2019re not playing of the Model Y because we\u2019re just not in production so you can\u2019t really read anything into Model Y orders at this point.","145":"David Tambourino","146":"Martin Viecha","147":"Okay. Well, then my second question would just be if you anticipate a further price adjustment the next level view credit phasing out July 1?","148":"Elon Musk","149":"We don\u2019t comment on future price changes unless you see it publicly.","150":"Martin Viecha","151":"Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","152":"Operator","153":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.","154":"Colin Rusch","155":"Yes, could you comment on whether you\u2019ll be better constrained at 100,000 vehicles a quarter in 2Q?","156":"Elon Musk","157":"Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Tesla\u2019s first quarter 2019 Q&A webcast. I am joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the updated letter we published at the same link as this webcast.","158":"Self-constrained you mean? We don\u2019t feel constrained at 400,000.","159":"Colin Rusch","160":"And then as you look at the Maxwell Technology integration, post close, how quickly do you think you\u2019ll be able to integrate that technology into the battery production? And could you comment on potential for chemistry and form factor changes as you get it integrated?","161":"Elon Musk","162":"I mean, you\u2019re really asking some pretty super secret sauce questions here. I think yes, we\u2019ll have I think we\u2019ll probably have an Investor Day like an Autonomy Day maybe later this year or early next just to go over the cell and battery technology and future strategy. And think that will be very informative but we do recognize the criticality of this.","163":"Colin Rusch","164":"Okay thank you so much guys.","165":"Operator","166":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","167":"Joseph Spak","168":"During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","169":"First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin that you\u2019re targeting. Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?","170":"Zachary Kirkhorn","171":"Yes, this is Zach here, that\u2019s [indiscernible] so we\u2019re targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. The biggest lever there is actually two components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there\u2019s just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us. But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we\u2019re executing on over the course of the year. And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we\u2019re seeing an increased take rate on our full Self-Driving offering. And there are, revenue associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there. And as that option becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more revenue on that. So all of these things together within our internal gives us [indiscernible].","172":"Elon Musk","173":"Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume, we\u2019re driving units of the Model 3 which is extremely efficient magnet motor and product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X. And so, we\u2019re actually able to get cost reduction while improving range and [indiscernible] of the car. That\u2019s just 1 example.","174":"Joseph Spak","175":"Okay. The second question is just looking at the 10-K, you\u2019ve notice $4.9 billion purchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1. And then Elon, in some of your communication, you\u2019ve indicated production constraints. I guess the question is, does that $4.9 billion correlate to reaching that 35 gigawatt hour rate? And if you can\u2019t hit that because of production constraints, does that adjust?","176":"Unidentified Company Speaker","177":"This is [indiscernible]. So, the purchase obligation in the 10-K is basically for the entire contract which we have for Panasonic. It\u2019s not something that we need to hit. I mean, make the purchases tomorrow. So this is going to take a couple of years.","178":"Joseph Spak","179":"Elon Musk","180":"Okay.","181":"Operator","182":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","183":"Colin Langan","184":"Great thanks for taking my question I mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a demand issue for some of the product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when there is a demand issue. So, what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?","185":"Elon Musk","186":"I mean, our goal, as we\u2019ve been very clear about from the beginning of the company, is to make our cars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important more people realizing in range and posher interior and Autopilot. So, we thought a product that\u2019s really just knows the sweet spot, which I think the $39,500 Model 3 is just really nail the sweet spot and raising consumer response accordingly. You can tell by the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn\u2019t have Autopilot and has a software introspection, that kind of thing. It\u2019s like slightly more inconvenience to buy just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So, it\u2019s just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something. But we see very few people actually take us up on that $35,000 offer, but it\u2019s there and will remain there.","187":"Colin Langan","188":"As a follow up, you\u2019re still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year. Are you still confident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that\u2019s getting pretty close to the point?","189":"Elon Musk","190":"Thanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.","191":"Yes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well. Tesla the execution of our team underground there. I get daily e-mails with Tesla picture from one day to next from Tom who leads the Gigafactory program. And so, we\u2019re obviously discussing or getting updates 7 days a week. So, I mean, I\u2019m in that Gigafactory e-mail. So, in terms of execution, of course, the production grows as fast as the [indiscernible] item. That\u2019s very important to bear in mind. So, we have 99% of things in good shape can make the car. So, with respect to that said, it looks like we\u2019ll reach volume production at the end of this year with, let\u2019s say, more than 1,000 cars a week, maybe 2,000 from Shanghai Giga at the end of this year. That\u2019s what it looks like to be the case right now. If it\u2019s not at the end, it will be shortly thereafter. And then we expect to have multiple sales flyers for Shanghai Giga.","192":"Martin Viecha","193":"Great. Thank you very much everyone. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for our Q&A today. Appreciate all of your questions, and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter.","194":"Operator","195":"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","196":"We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving. We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving. We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps \u2013 yes. Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China. As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them. This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1. This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.","197":"So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles \u2013 vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time. The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter. This will make the \u2013 this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.","198":"Elon Musk - Chief Executive Officer","199":"In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost 60%. It\u2019s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago. There are literally \u2013 best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world. And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well. So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.","200":"Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car. They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3. And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains. So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is \u2013 and there are number of other small changes. If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free. So this is \u2013 yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.","201":"So, they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This would actually be at a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster and they were any headwind as well. So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California. I mean, I have never \u2013 back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception. And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way. And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.","202":"So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production levels. And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will fundamentally transform transport as we know it. The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version 3 on the energy side. And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the world. And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.","203":"Martin Viecha","204":"Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.","205":"Zachary Kirkhorn","206":"Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla\u2019s standards. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter. We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.","207":"First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows. The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1. We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.","208":"On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter. So, we are addressing this by regionally \u2013 by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two. The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. So, we don\u2019t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet. We expect significant cost savings to come from this.","209":"J.B. Straubel - Chief Technology Officer","210":"On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that\u2019s led through to net income. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28. This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes. There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.","211":"Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted. If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries. Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%. This is due to two factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1. In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.","212":"As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon\u2019s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup. From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world. So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that. And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for capital efficient expansion. In energy as well, as we have noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned investments in that.","213":"So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company and I am looking forward to the discussion.","214":"Martin Viecha","215":"Thank you very much, Zachary. Let\u2019s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com. So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies? What is holding that back?","216":"Elon Musk","217":"Jonathan, do you want to?","218":"Jonathan Chang","219":"Yes, hi, it\u2019s Jonathan Chang as our Counsel here. Right now, we are just going through approvals with the SEC. There is not a whole lot of things holding it back. We are on schedule, we are on track. Right now, we are looking to close in mid-May.","220":"Zachary Kirkhorn - Chief Financial Officer","221":"Elon Musk","222":"Great. Thanks.","223":"Martin Viecha","224":"Thank you. The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in order to further simplify the ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety of driving in Autopilot? The insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla ownership right now.","225":"Elon Musk","226":"The answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month. It will be much more compelling than anything else out there.","227":"Martin Viecha","228":"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the company?","229":"Elon Musk","230":"Sure. The challenge really is battery cells scarcity. As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?","231":"Jonathan Chang - General Counsel","232":"J.B. Straubel","233":"Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.","234":"Elon Musk","235":"Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a \u2013 quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don\u2019t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It\u2019s much faster than an automotive. So over time, we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla\u2019s business over time. We also have \u2013 we are also finding a significant increase in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally refined the product offering to be something that\u2019s extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install. So, to radically streamline process from what has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of 20, 25 years and so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down by [indiscernible] which you can do accelerate aging on the roof and we want the installation process to be simple and easy, which is actually the Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the team and we are looking forward to scaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.","236":"Martin Viecha","237":"Thank you very much. The next question comes from Jeffrey, when and where will the Tesla semi production begin?","238":"Jerome Guillen","239":"This is Jerome. Next year we will start production. We are very happy with driving the trucks extensively with I think so far quite amazing success, yes.","240":"Elon Musk","241":"The prototypes are working amazingly well.","242":"Jerome Guillen \u2013 President, Automotive Division","243":"Jerome Guillen","244":"Yes, very well. We just used them all the time. We load them to maximum weight and continue to make improvements.","245":"Elon Musk","246":"So, we have even used them to deliver some Model 3s.","247":"Jerome Guillen","248":"Yes, that was fun. So, yes, we will start production next year. The location was not yet set, but it\u2019s pretty clear that we make all the batteries and driving it in Reno.","249":"Martin Viecha","250":"Great. Thank you very much.","251":"Elon Musk","252":"Sparks technically.","253":"Conference Call Participants","254":"Jerome Guillen","255":"Sparks, yes. Northern Nevada.","256":"Elon Musk","257":"Yes, Northern Nevada.","258":"Martin Viecha","259":"And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon should current owners that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?","260":"Elon Musk","261":"I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don\u2019t really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That\u2019s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware. So, just no need to rush to the \u2013 get your computer replaced. It\u2019s like 2 to 3 months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially. For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y. So, we don\u2019t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it\u2019s hardly a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.","262":"Martin Viecha","263":"Thank you very much. Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.","264":"Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","265":"Question-and-Answer Session","266":"Operator","267":"Thank you. Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","268":"Ryan Brinkman","269":"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second. Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or reservation list maybe telling you?","270":"Elon Musk","271":"Yes. We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3. The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade. So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant. And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don\u2019t like buying cars in winter and we are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December 31. So, these were all very positive factors. We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model 3. So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries. Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.","272":"Ryan Brinkman","273":"Okay, thanks. And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, because it was I think you said packed to the gills. I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada. Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?","274":"Elon Musk","275":"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:","276":"Company Participants","277":"Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","278":"So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was - on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change.","279":"As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year.","280":"Operator","281":"Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're now live.","282":"John Blackledge","283":"Great. Thanks. Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the one-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one-day at some point?","284":"And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods. Thank you.","285":"Brian Olsavsky","286":"Sure. So, yes, on the one-day free shipping versus the two-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the two-day free shipping program into a one-day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.","287":"We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing something very important for the customer. And we have - again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that one-day category.","288":"Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","289":"Dave Fildes","290":"And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the two-hour or even one-hour delivery capabilities.","291":"And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean\u2013 and in other initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a number of initiatives there. So excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space.","292":"Operator","293":"Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now live.","294":"Ben Schachter","295":"So more on the one-day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year? Thanks.","296":"Brian Olsavsky","297":"Yeah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time.","298":"I would like to - as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around one-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX-neutral growth and $2 billion more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1.","299":"Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Inc.","300":"The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business.","301":"We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time.","302":"We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.","303":"Operator","304":"Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live.","305":"Mark May","306":"Thank you. And actually a follow-on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. Just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out, that may have contributed to that.","307":"And apologize, but another one-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks.","308":"Brian Olsavsky","309":"Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's - let me start with that second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America. But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more going forward.","310":"John Blackledge - Cowen Inc.","311":"I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because we are still again working through that. And while we have ratcheted up a significant - we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter.","312":"I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year.","313":"This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion - greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.","314":"Operator","315":"Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.","316":"Heath Terry","317":"Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx sort of tracks your - that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect.","318":"I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the extent that your - the level of investment in physical infrastructures says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is?","319":"Brian Olsavsky","320":"Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath. No, I would say, A, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with our capital. I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure.","321":"Ben Schachter - Macquarie Group","322":"But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers.","323":"And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously.","324":"Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year. And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say.","325":"Although, we did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us.","326":"Operator","327":"Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.","328":"Brian Nowak","329":"Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one-day shipping. So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked about record Prime sub-growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries you think this will help you attract and retain?","330":"It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in one-day? And then the second one, just maybe talk to us a little bit about the early learnings on the healthcare industry side of potentially trying to move larger into healthcare? Thanks.","331":"Brian Olsavsky","332":"Mark May - Citigroup","333":"Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to one-day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in two days.","334":"If we get that to one-day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that. But the - we think that that will open up a lot of potential purchases that - and it will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you know, two-day, one-day, same-day, two-hour, stores, there's all types of - points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points in their consideration set.","335":"So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it. But I thank you for your question.","336":"Dave Fildes","337":"Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great selection. And fast delivery is part of that - the business program there. So - and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve.","338":"PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to be sure.","339":"Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","340":"Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs Group","341":"Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley","342":"Operator","343":"Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.","344":"Shelly Kay Pfeiffer - Investor Relations","345":"For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.","346":"Shelly Kay Pfeiffer","347":"Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018.","348":"Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","349":"During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.","350":"Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.","351":"Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.","352":"With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.","353":"Question-and-Answer Session","354":"Operator","355":"Brian Olsavsky - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","356":"At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live.","357":"Mark Mahaney","358":"Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk to us a little bit about that.","359":"And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last - ex-FX. I know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate, how do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India? Thanks a lot.","360":"Brian Olsavsky","361":"Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, also it doesn't include Whole Foods Market.","362":"So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the progress of the business in India.","363":"So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India.","364":"Operator","365":"Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. You are now live.","366":"Dave Fildes - Director of Investor Relations","367":"Doug Anmuth","368":"Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you.","369":"Brian Olsavsky","370":"Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%.","371":"So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis.","372":"So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue.","373":"So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us.","374":"For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis.","375":"But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping.","376":"So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. And we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve this offer.","377":"Conference Call Participants","378":"And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year.","379":"Doug Anmuth","380":"Thank you.","381":"Brian Olsavsky","382":"And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we expect - we built the Q2 range about - around what we've seen.","383":"Operator","384":"Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.","385":"Justin Post","386":"Great. Thank you. As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you.","387":"Brian Olsavsky","388":"Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","389":"Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky.","390":"So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say.","391":"Operator","392":"Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live.","393":"Eric Sheridan","394":"Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform?","395":"And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. Thanks so much.","396":"Brian Olsavsky","397":"Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers.","398":"So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements.","399":"Doug Anmuth - J.P. Morgan & Co.","400":"And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon.","401":"And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.","402":"Operator","403":"Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live.","404":"Stephen Ju","405":"I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very dedicated number of customers? Thanks.","406":"Brian Olsavsky","407":"Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app.","408":"So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification.","409":"So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.","410":"Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","411":"Operator","412":"Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. You're now live.","413":"Daniel Salmon","414":"Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers?","415":"And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're understanding that quickly that - this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly.","416":"Brian Olsavsky","417":"Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery.","418":"So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned, because we'll be building this - most of this capacity through the year in 2019.","419":"And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.","420":"Operator","421":"Eric Sheridan - UBS","422":"Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. You're now live.","423":"Anthony DiClemente","424":"Thanks very much. A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business?","425":"And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content? Thanks.","426":"Brian Olsavsky","427":"Yeah. Let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection.","428":"We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country.","429":"So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.","430":"Dave Fildes","431":"Yeah. And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles.","432":"Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:","433":"Company Participants","434":"Eric Sheridan \u2013 UBS","435":"A few years ago, we probably would\u2019ve rolled this out and tried to deal with issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground up, getting this right upfront. So the playbook is going to be work on getting the basics right, make sure that we have safety rights from the beginning. In countries where we already are the leading platform, there will be more ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in additional ways that people want to interact privately. But in terms of when I expect this to be a real contributor to the business, I don\u2019t think in the next couple of years that\u2019s going to be a major driver. This is just a big focus for us which is why I\u2019m talking about it now.","436":"Dave Wehner","437":"So Doug, it\u2019s Dave. I\u2019ll take the question on Stories. So we are seeing more of our impression growth coming from Stories, and when I outlined the factors driving impression growth, I listed Stories first. It was the largest contributor of year-over-year impression growth in the quarter. But those impressions are coming in at lower prices than we see in feed. So if anything, the mix shift on growth towards Stories is certainly in the near term a headwind on revenue growth.","438":"On pricing specifically, we\u2019re seeing such strong impression growth that this supply growth keeps prices low and creates an opportunity for advertisers, and we\u2019re seeing smart advertisers take advantage of that. Ultimately, we believe we can increase demand for Stories as we attract more advertisers and bring more effective direct response units to Stories. But this \u2013 and over time, that will play through to increased prices but this is going to take years, not quarters. So at least in the near term, we\u2019re going to see a meaningful discount on prices on Stories.","439":"Operator","440":"Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","441":"Brian Nowak","442":"Thanks for taking my question; I have two. Just to go back to the story monetization point with the 3 million advertisers, could you just talk us through some of the main strategies you\u2019ve used to really drive the Stories advertiser adoption? And then any clarity you can help us better understand what type of lifts you\u2019re seeing in spend per advertiser as they start to spend on both News Feed and Stories?","443":"And then, Dave, just to come back to your comments about revenue for the year you mentioned the ad targeting headwinds would be more pronounced in the second half. Can you help us better understand why that is, the sort of changes to expect that would drive that? Thanks.","444":"Sheryl Sandberg","445":"Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","446":"Yes, this is Sheryl; I\u2019ll take the Stories question. So one of the things we learned is that consumers usually move to new features, to new products, to new places before marketers, and it\u2019s really up to us to help marketers move there quickly. We definitely saw that with mobile, that one of the barriers was convincing marketers that they needed to be with mobile. But then there was a second barrier which was just making it easier for them to do it. If you take your long TV ad or your 30-second TV spot and you just put it on mobile, it doesn\u2019t perform as well as a mobile first ad, and that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve worked on.","447":"Now, we\u2019re really applying that lesson to Stories. First, we need to convince marketers that people are using Stories, and I think having seen the mobile shift, their process \u2013 they\u2019re getting that I think more quickly. But then we have to make it easy. So if you look at some of the tools and products I\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, now you can \u2013 rather than us saying to you, go make a Stories ad you can just send us some pictures, some text, some very easy posts and we will create some Stories ads for you.","448":"So our process is, we have one sales team selling all of these products; I think that helps us a lot because they already have those relationships. And we\u2019re doing all we can to make it very easy to adopt the format. We also want to make this as automated as possible. So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad you\u2019ve produced, and we can do the placement for you, because we think over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be placed and even helping you target until you\u2019re seeing us build tools in that direction as well.","449":"In terms of how much of its incremental, I\u2019m sure not all of it is. There\u2019s \u2013 definitely has to be some cannibalization for people who are doing feed ads as they get Stories. But we\u2019ve seen that over time as we move people we\u2019re able to get increasing shares, hopefully, of their budget but it\u2019s our job to earn that. We tell marketers all over the world that we want to be the best dollar, the best minute, the best euro they spend and it\u2019s up to us to prove that ROI and we\u2019re going to continue to do that.","450":"Dave Wehner","451":"Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Dave. We already talked about on the supply side the impact that Stories is having. And the supply growth really getting driven by Stories is coming through at lower prices, so that\u2019s one of the factors that factors into the lower growth outlook for the second half. But on the demand side, want to specifically call out several factors that are contributing to ad targeting headwinds. The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR. The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\u2019ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world. That means those people are seeing less relevant ads and that\u2019s an ad targeting headwind for our business.","452":"The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will make that will make targeting and measurement more difficult. And the third is Facebook \u2013 our own product changes. For example, in the fall we plan to roll out our tool for seeing and clearing your off-Facebook browsing history. In addition, we\u2019ve introduced restrictions on the use of certain targeting criteria from some ads. So we\u2019re seeing a cumulative impact from all of these factors leading to \u2013 leading to what we expect to be targeting headwinds for the \u2013 for the back half of the year.","453":"Operator","454":"Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","455":"Heather Bellini","456":"Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Evercore","457":"Great. Thank you. I had two questions. The first one I guess, Mark, was given the focus on back-end integration that you\u2019ve been talking about and a platform increasingly focused on privacy, I was wondering how you think about the incremental expenses, if any, to achieve this? And in particular, if I go back to your comments on your third quarter earnings call, you commented that over time, you knew there was a need to ensure that costs and revenue were better matched. Does any of your recent areas of focus change your timeframe associated with that to occur? And then I had a follow-up on IGTV and Watch. I was just wondering if you could share with us how these are performing versus your expectations and kind of what the differences are that you are seeing between the two? Thank you.","458":"Dave Wehner","459":"Heather, I can \u2013 I can take that. I mean in terms of the focus on privacy, the one thing that I would \u2013 I would sort of cite there, if anything the priority for messaging is clear, the focus on privacy and interoperability, and that means that monetization for messaging is a lower, near-term priority so that has some \u2013 has some impact on the outlook. And then when it comes to how we\u2019re thinking about expense growth as we look beyond 2019, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance but I\u2019d note that we continue to invest aggressively across the business and there\u2019s no change in our long-term outlook on the need to invest heavily in areas like safety and security, innovation in our core product and infrastructure and the ultimate impact that those will have on our operating margin. So, we\u2019re still positioned to invest aggressively both in 2019 and beyond. On IGTV and Watch, do you want to \u2013 does anybody want to take that or...?","460":"Mark Zuckerberg","461":"Well if you were going to \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to do the numbers and then I\u2019ll do the color. Go for it with whatever you wanted to say and then I\u2019ll jump in after.","462":"All right, we\u2019ll \u2013 before we get to IGTV and Watch, I\u2019ll just add on the cost point that this is something that I\u2019m focused on personally. I care a lot about making sure that we want make the right investments in safety and innovation long-term, so I\u2019m committed to doing that. But of course, I get that in running a company you don\u2019t want to have costs growing at a much faster rate than your revenue for a long period of time. And that\u2019s why I called that out last time exactly, because I care about making sure that we get that back more and more in line soon.","463":"On Watch, generally this is starting to go quite well. There\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s early, but one of the big questions around Watch that we had early on was what is going to be people\u2019s demand to go to a separate tab to have an experience that\u2019s dedicated to interacting with people around a certain type of content? If you remember the reason why we got to this strategy, it was because people wanted to watch a lot of video, but we saw that passive consumption of video was displacing social interactions and News Feed.","464":"And when you think about what Facebook stands for in the world, and the really unique value that we can deliver to people, it\u2019s primarily around helping people stay connected and have a meaningful interaction. So, it was really important to me, and I think to making \u2013 to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction. While people wanted to consume a lot of video and we thought that there were new ways that people could interact around that, we wanted to create a separate place, where people could go to do that.","465":"And one of the big open questions was to what extent, what percent of people are going to want to go and do this? And now it was more than 100 million people doing this, I think we\u2019ve really proven as part of that hypothesis, that this is something that people are going to want to go do. That also not only with Watch, which is continuing to grow quickly, this also opens up opportunities around things \u2013 around doing this around areas like news, which I\u2019ve recently started talking about.","466":"And I don\u2019t have anything too specific to add today, we\u2019re trying to take a very consultative approach to how we develop anything around news or any of the things that touch the big social issues and certainly, supporting journalism is up there as one of the really important things that we care about. So, we want to make sure we do this in a consultative away with a lot of folks in journalism and in the industry. But as Watch has grown, it has proven to us that that these sub-experiences as part of our different apps, similar with IGTV, can be quite successful. And that\u2019s an optimistic sign for me for the future.","467":"Mark May \u2013 Citi","468":"Operator","469":"Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.","470":"Eric Sheridan","471":"Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. Mark, for you, I guess as we read your statements and listened to you on the calls over the last sort of a year and a half, the end of 2017, I think investors are still trying to figure out the future business model and monetization path for Facebook as a company. Is it more media consumption and advertising driven or do you think you are in the process of a pivot towards more e-commerce? And we know there\u2019s a privacy focus over all of that. But I\u2019d love sort of your view on how you think about the puts and takes between an ad driven model and an e-commerce driven model or somewhere in between those two as you look out over the next three to five years? And I don\u2019t know if this is best for Dave or not, but on the FTC, you threw out 3 billion to 5 billion, what sort of probability should we assume to that being the likely outcome within that range and how should we think about some of the changes if any that might happen to the business model if you were to settle with the FTC? Thanks so much, guys.","472":"Dave Wehner","473":"I can take for the FTC one first, Eric. Look, the accruals and accounting entry related to the ongoing settlement discussions that we\u2019re having with the FTC. This matter\u2019s not resolved, so the actual amount of payment remains uncertain. However, we\u2019re estimating this range of loss to be $3 billion to $5 billion. Can\u2019t really comment further as this is an ongoing matter. We booked at the low end of the range in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. So, really not much more to add on that front.","474":"Mark Zuckerberg","475":"Sure. And in-between advertising and commerce, it\u2019s really a continuous spectrum and they\u2019re not two different things, right? Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019ve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what we\u2019re going this is we\u2019re going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform. But I would expect that that will mostly come and affect the business through as those products that we build help businesses convert better, they\u2019ll \u2013 it will be more valuable to them and therefore that\u2019ll translate into higher bids for the advertising and that\u2019ll be how we see it.","476":"Over the long-term, if Payments becomes a really important part of what we do, we can \u2013 we\u2019ll have some options and choices about how we choose to \u2013 how to have the revenue flow to us in the future. But for the near-term, the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is offering as many of these things at cost and for free as possible to deliver as much value to small businesses and businesses around the world. And I would imagine that that will come and contribute to our business through advertising in the way that it has historically.","477":"Operator","478":"Ross Sandler \u2013 Barclays","479":"Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","480":"Justin Post","481":"Great. A couple of questions. Thank you. First, Dave, does your revenue outlook include any contemplated regulatory changes between now and the fall? And then second just kind of wondering if anything caused the expense forecast to go slightly down this year? And just maybe, if you could give us an update on the 35% long-term target margin you provided, I believe on the July call, last year? Thank you.","482":"Dave Wehner","483":"Thanks, Justin. On the revenue outlook, I\u2019m not exactly sure what you\u2019re getting at with the contemplated regulatory changes. But I did cite that one of the factors in the expected deceleration was the ongoing impact of the evolution of the regulatory landscape from things like GDPR and the number of people, who are opting out of using context from third-party apps and websites. That is going to we expect continue to increase. As well as we\u2019re making our own product changes with things like tools for seeing and clearing your off-Facebook history and restricting use of some ad targeting. And some of that is in response to just the evolution of the regulatory landscape. So, I think it does factor into it.","484":"In terms of the expense guidance, we don\u2019t have a specific update on a long-term margin target. But I would just note that we are not changing our overall philosophy of continuing to invest aggressively across the business in these important areas like safety, and security and innovation, which are going to play into continued expense growth both in 2019 and 2020. No real change in there; it\u2019s more a question of pacing and better visibility on the pace of head count growth and investment in 2019. But the ultimate end outcome, I don\u2019t think is changing on that front. We\u2019re still expecting to continue to invest aggressively in the business, and that will have an impact on operating margins.","485":"Operator","486":"Your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.","487":"Anthony DiClemente","488":"Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Sheryl and one for Dave. Sheryl, just on checkout, Instagram checkout, maybe talk specifically about the improvements that reduced friction can provide to marketers in terms of ROI on their ads, in terms of the benefits that are created from the reduced friction of buying a product without leaving the app?","489":"Lloyd Walmsley \u2013 Deutsche Bank","490":"And then maybe for Dave, just noticed that the daily active users on Facebook in the U.S. and Canada were stable sequentially. So anything around that in terms of what does your revenue outlook kind of assume in terms of will there be continued stability there? Any color around what you're seeing in terms of its time spent or engagement on Facebook would be really helpful. Thank you.","491":"Sheryl Sandberg","492":"So in shopping in general, we do see a lot of interest in our apps and shopping. Instagram specifically where we launched checkout, 130 million Instagram accounts are tapping to reveal products or learn more about products in posts every month. So I think there is a real opportunity. We're excited about checkout but I really want to stress how early this is. This is a small closed beta with 23 brands and for us that's obviously a very small number.","493":"And it's not primarily a monetization product as your question assumes. Really, the benefit here is enabling a better experience for people, that when they're interested in a product they can learn more and checkout right there. Obviously, if people learn about things through our ads and then close the loop all the way to purchase, it's very strong for proving ROI, it also helps as a measure that return as well. We're excited about this kind of thing but this is as early as anything could be.","494":"Dave Wehner","495":"Yes, Anthony, on the DAU in the U.S. and Canada, yes, true, that was stable so in terms of the number of DAU quarter-over-quarter. And I think that broadly paints the right picture in terms of engagement as well. We're not providing a specific time spent update but I think it paints the picture well on the DAU front.","496":"In terms of the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. and Canada on the revenue front, obviously, Instagram is playing a big, big role there and the growth of impressions from Stories is factoring into it. And at the same time we're seeing continued pricing growth on feed, and that's true for both Facebook and Instagram. And there, we're relying on continuing to improve targeting. And so you've got \u2013 the risk there is of course the headwinds that we talked about on the ad targeting front and how that will play into U.S. growth as well.","497":"Operator","498":"Your next question comes from Mark May from Citi.","499":"Mark May","500":"Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","501":"Thank you. To Sheryl's earlier point about the evolution of Stories, the perception is the core Facebook user adoption of Stories format has been \u2013 hasn't been all that meaningful. How would you characterize the adoption on core Facebook? And if it is in fact relatively low, is that important for the company to address?","502":"And then secondly with impression growth of, I think you said, Dave, 32%, that's obviously significantly higher than the 8% growth in MAUs. What would you largely attribute that to? Is that a reflection of improving engagement or the ability to kind of increase ad loads globally? Thanks.","503":"Sheryl Sandberg","504":"So on Facebook Stories, we have 0.5 billion people using it daily, and we think that's pretty impressive growth; we're seeing real engagement. In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.","505":"To share one example, a local e-commerce jewelry brand called Lokai started donating 10% of their net profits to charitable partners. And they started running video ads in Facebook Stories and News Feed. And just the addition of Facebook Stories drove 26% more additions to their checkout cart. So I think we are seeing that \u2013 including on Facebook, including in ads even though it's earlier \u2013 the additional opportunity is big.","506":"Dave Wehner","507":"So Mark, it's Dave. So in the impression growth I sort of cited the drivers in order of impact, and I listed Instagram Stories first and then Instagram Feed. Stories it is the biggest individual driver of impression growth, and we talked about how that is coming through at lower prices. And there's some opportunity to increase \u2013 we were seeing increased engagement in Stories and there's some opportunity to increase load growing forward.","508":"On Instagram Feed, which was the second factor, we have seen some increase in ad load on Instagram on a year-over-year basis, but we expect that there'll be less significant growth opportunities going forward on Instagram Feed ad load.","509":"And then finally, you've got \u2013 you have Facebook Feed which we're still seeing impression growth and that's coming around the globe. And we're tending to see growth in \u2013 outside the U.S. and Canada. So that gives you some color on the sort of the type of impression growth that we're seeing.","510":"Operator","511":"Colin Sebastian \u2013 Baird","512":"Your next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.","513":"Ross Sandler","514":"Great. Mark, so you mentioned payments and commerce a bunch of times in your March letter and also today. So I guess can you talk about how you see the strategy developing for payments and commerce on WhatsApp compared to maybe what you see broadly out there from other folks building these capabilities around messaging? And then what timeline should we expect to start to see some of this come out? And lastly any insights on what the blockchain team at Facebook is working on and how does that potentially tie into the overall payment strategy? Thanks.","515":"Mark Zuckerberg","516":"Sure. Across the \u2013 commerce and payments are an area that I'm quite focused on and optimistic about across all of our different services. So in Instagram and Facebook, you have shopping, and you have Marketplace and you have all the tens of millions of small businesses that use pages and a lot that use Instagram for sharing their inventory and being able to help people discover and pay.","517":"Through messaging specifically, I'm more optimistic because of the private nature of this space, right? It feels \u2013 when you're using a messaging service, that everything there is very intimate and private so it feels like a more natural space to be interacting with a business in a private way for doing transactions.","518":"So I think what we're going to end up seeing is building out Payments, which is going to end up being something that we do country-by-country \u2013 we have a test that is running in India for WhatsApp now, we're hoping to launch in several other countries at some point, but I don't want to put a timeframe on that here, but it's something that we're actively working on.","519":"And the goal would be to have something where you can do discovery through the broader town square-like platforms in Instagram and Facebook. And then you can complete the transactions and follow up with businesses individually and have an ongoing relationship through Messenger and WhatsApp.","520":"And it's \u2013 this is one of the things that I think will create a lot of value for people discovering and interacting with businesses. I don't know many people who like calling businesses to deal with issues that they have. I think being able to handle that through messaging is going to be a great experience. For businesses I think that this is going to help complete the loop and help them to actually sell more things which ultimately is what they care about when they're using the platform. So this is just a big opportunity, and one of the areas that I'm quite excited about.","521":"Operator","522":"John Blackledge \u2013 Cowen","523":"Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.","524":"Lloyd Walmsley","525":"Thanks. Had a couple of related to the commerce topic. Know it's early on Instagram, but in the blog post you all alluded to opening up the platform more broadly. So wondering kind of what the timeline might be? And how easy will it be for smaller businesses to integrate here?","526":"And then I guess second one related to that would be, as you start to test this with checkout on Instagram, do you see any change from participating brands in their strategy around ad spend on the platform as part of those tests and kind of how that might evolve over time?","527":"Dave Wehner","528":"Yes. And Sheryl can add some color here but, Lloyd, it's Dave. I just want to make sure, I mean we've got a very small closed beta with 23 brands. It's very early days and it will take a while for this to have any impact. So I just \u2013 I think it's something we'll be watching and nurturing but it's going to take a while before Instagram Shopping has any meaningful impact on the business.","529":"Sheryl Sandberg","530":"And we haven't announced anything in terms of opening up the product more broadly so that people can buy sign up automatically which is where small businesses would come in. We're going to get feedback and expand in time. But with all of these things we're doing very small slowly, we have a lot of teams working on a lot of very important projects in ads, and this is one we're going to roll out very slowly and carefully.","531":"Operator","532":"Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","533":"Youssef Squali \u2013 SunTrust","534":"Michael Nathanson","535":"Thanks. I have one for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, I appreciate your call about regulating the Internet. You've been outspoken on that. I just wonder if you have any views on the EU copyright directive which YouTube has been critical of or the Australia law about violent material? And if those laws become more global, do you think the company is prepared operationally to protect the platform from those types of challenges by regulators?","536":"Sheryl Sandberg","537":"So we're working with policymakers to ensure that people can share and express themselves while still protecting copyright. In terms of the experience in Europe, some of the provisions could impact the user experience in Europe but we're going to continue to work with policymakers to try to get the balance right.","538":"Operator","539":"Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.","540":"Colin Sebastian","541":"Great. Maybe a quick follow-up on the platform safety issue, maybe specifically with respect to broadcast. Wondering how close you are in terms of the ability to prevent harmful posts or videos from reaching users on a real-time basis? And how much of this can realistically be done today using AI versus more manual processes?","542":"And then secondly, Mark, just considering the fast adoption of voice interactions in interfaces online, how should we think about Facebook's strategy and competitive positioning as an opportunity to strengthen the connections that exist between the apps or would voice interaction being a distinct feature perhaps within the apps? Thank you.","543":"Mark Zuckerberg","544":"Deborah Crawford \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations","545":"Operator","546":"Sure. So on safety, I think given the volume of content that people share, if you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us who can then look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those after they've already seen them. The reactive model of waiting for people in the community to flag them guarantees that by the time that we get to look at an issue someone has already seen that content, which is not the state that we want to be in.","547":"So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is where we have these transparency reports \u2013 right now every six months, but we want to get to quarterly on those soon. And in those transparency reports, we break down every category of harmful content, everything from terrorism, to hate speech, to bullying, to nudity. And in each one, we talk about the prevalence of the content that people see because we think what matters is the number of impressions or people who are seeing the content, not just \u2013 not if a lot of people are sharing something but no one sees it \u2013 but what is actually getting seen. One piece of content that gets seen by a lot of people is a big deal.","548":"And then in these reports, we also talk about and show what percent of the content we handle proactively and identify proactively. And our goal is to get that to be as high as possible. In areas like terrorism, for Al Qaeda and ISIS related content, now 99% of the content that we take down in the category our systems flag proactively before anyone sees it. That's what really good looks like.","549":"I don't know that in every category we're going to be able to get to 99%; certainly not in the next six months or a year. But my hope would be that we can get to 90-plus percent on most of these categories within the next couple of years. And that's I think the best hope for doing this. That's going to be a bit continued investment and something that we really care about getting right.","550":"The other question was about voice. Most of what we build \u2013 one of the things that\u2019s different about Facebook and social products is more of it is about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with us, right? And so we\u2019re certainly very focused on things like video calling and voice calling and ways that people can communicate with voice. We have worked on some voice products on Portal; that\u2019s an important way that people interact. And having Portal out in the market has been very valuable in terms of seeing how people want to use that and for \u2013 so our teams can have a real target to shoot at and iterate on and continue improving week over week. That\u2019s been a meaningful improvement. But in all of these different ways, voice and how people interact with each other and eventually building products that allow people to interface with our products through that, we\u2019re quite focused on this.","551":"Operator","552":"Your next question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen.","553":"John Blackledge","554":"Great. Thanks. Could you provide some color on ad loads for Instagram Stories versus Instagram Feed at this point? And also any color on how conversion rates have trended on Stories ads and Instagram over the past year? And then other question, just on CapEx, the guide was brought \u2013 was brought down slightly. Just any callout out there and any view on longer-term CapEx on given the ramp the past couple years? Thank you.","555":"Dave Wehner","556":"Good afternoon. My name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.","557":"Sure. I\u2019ll take that, John. So on the ad load for Instagram Stories versus Instagram Feed. I mean it\u2019s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed, because there\u2019s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls. It\u2019s a little bit different than Feed posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit. But we do have opportunities we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed are \u2013 we think the opportunities are much more limited to increase ad load going forward.","558":"In terms of conversion rates, I\u2019d probably just go back to the discussion that we had on pricing and the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of supply opportunity, and pricing is clearly lower on Stories than on Feed. Part of that is due to the fact that we don\u2019t have as many direct response formats in Stories, so that reduces the opportunities for conversion opportunities on Stories. And as we are more effective at getting direct response into Stories, that should improve, so some opportunity there.","559":"On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how spend will come through. A big component of CapEx\u2019s data center builds. Those are large complex projects, so the timing of that spend, we just get better visibility on as the year progresses, but no real change in outlook. We\u2019re continuing to invest heavily in the business.","560":"The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come up, and part of what is driving that are real changes in the business as it relates to our opportunity to deploy capital against things like ads targeting as well as the fact that we\u2019ve seen the user base growth shift to regions like Asia and we\u2019re now building our CapEx to what\u2019s effectively an Asian peak and so that\u2019s a lower ARPU user base. So that does have some impact on capital intensity and part of the driver, where we\u2019re seeing kind of capital intensity increase over the \u2013 over the past several years.","561":"Deborah Crawford","562":"Operator, we\u2019re going to take one last question.","563":"Operator","564":"The last question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust.","565":"Youssef Squali","566":"Great. Thank you very much. I actually just have one question around regulation. Mark, you\u2019ve been obviously pushing for clearer rules of the road for you and for the other companies to play by. What have been the feedback so far from regulators? How long do you think it\u2019ll take to come to some sort of resolution, especially considering that we\u2019re going into this two-year election cycle? Thanks.","567":"Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","568":"Mark Zuckerberg","569":"Well, one of the things that I\u2019ve been focused on is trying to help develop global frameworks where possible, but the challenge of course, with that is that except in a limited number of cases, regulation typically isn\u2019t global; it\u2019s national. So, I would expect that we\u2019ll see different countries make progress on different timeframes. I had a recent trip, where I was in Berlin and Dublin, talking to a bunch of folks, who are policymakers or academics out there.","570":"And certainly, I think people are thinking about all of these issues. And certainly, Europe has led on areas like privacy regulation with GDPR, and is probably further along in thinking about how to think through issues around content regulation and safety as well. I think we\u2019ll see different paces of people doing things in different countries around the world, but a lot of what we hope that we can \u2013 that we can contribute to this discussion is as much as possible have shared frameworks for how the industry should operate around the world.","571":"Deborah Crawford","572":"Great, thank you. And thank you for joining us today, we appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.","573":"Operator","574":"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.","575":"Deborah Crawford","576":"Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.","577":"Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s press release, and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.","578":"During this call we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.","579":"And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark.","580":"Mark Zuckerberg","581":"Thanks Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. This was a strong quarter, and our community and business continued to grow. There are now around 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month, and more than 2.1 billion people are using at least one every day.","582":"Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","583":"We\u2019re continuing to see fast adoption of Stories with each of our three Stories experiences \u2013 Facebook and Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2013 having more than half a billion daily actives.","584":"Since our last call, I\u2019ve written about some major updates on the future of our services and how we\u2019re thinking about some of the important social issues facing the Internet. So, I\u2019ll focus my time today on these, starting with our privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking.","585":"The basic idea here is that in our lives, we all have public spaces like the town square and private spaces like our living rooms. In our digital lives, we also need both public and private spaces. For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalents of the town square where you can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once \u2013 stay in touch with your friends, meet new people, find communities that share your interests, start businesses, buy and sell things, and organize fundraisers for causes. They aren\u2019t just tools for sharing one thing; they\u2019re these whole rich platforms for lots of ways to interact in larger communities.","586":"Today, people increasingly want the intimacy of connecting privately as well, so I think there also needs to be a digital equivalent of the living room, a platform just as built out with all the ways that you\u2019d want to interact privately. We already see that in messages, small groups, and Stories are by far the fastest growing areas of online communication. And we also know that people want additional tools for private interactions like payments and commerce.","587":"I expect the digital town squares like Facebook and Instagram will always be important and will only continue to grow in importance, but there\u2019s a lot more to build there as well and I\u2019m excited about that. But over time, I believe that there\u2019s an even bigger opportunity with the digital living room to build a platform focused on privacy. We all need to communicate privately, and this service could be even more important in our lives. So, I think we should focus our efforts on building this privacy-focused platform.","588":"Our plan is to build this the way we\u2019ve developed WhatsApp; focused on the most fundamental and private use case, messaging, make it as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption, and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that. And this privacy-focused platform will be built around several principles: Private interactions. You should have simple, intimate spaces where you have complete confidence that what you say and do is private. Encryption. Your private communications should be secure, and end-to-end encryption prevents anyone \u2013 including even us \u2013 from seeing what you share.","589":"Reducing permanence. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about what you share is going back to hurt you later, so we won\u2019t keep around messages or Stories for longer than necessary. Safety. You should expect that we\u2019ll do everything we can to keep you safe on our services within the bounds of an encrypted service. So we\u2019re taking the time to get this right upfront before we ship this platform. Interoperability. You should be able to use any of our apps to reach your friends, and you should be able to communicate across our networks easily and securely.","590":"And finally, secure data storage. You should expect that we won\u2019t store sensitive data in countries where it might be improperly accessed because of weak rule of law or governments that can forcibly get access to your data.","591":"So over the next few years, we\u2019re going to rebuild more of our services around these ideas. There are a lot of open questions and real tradeoffs on important social issues, so we\u2019re committed to working openly on this and consulting with experts and governments as we go.","592":"Now, I know one of the questions we\u2019ve gotten frequently is about how this will affect our business. So, I\u2019ll address that here. The reality is any impact is going to be longer term and we don\u2019t know exactly how this will play out yet. But on some of the questions like whether encrypting content will hurt our business, I\u2019m more confident that won\u2019t be a significant issue. We don\u2019t use the content of messages between people to target ads today, so encrypting that content won\u2019t change what we do. It will strengthen people\u2019s privacy without meaningfully affecting our business.","593":"Sheryl Sandberg \u2013 Chief Operating Officer","594":"Similarly, reducing the permanence of data may have some impact, but we\u2019ve generally found that more recent data is more useful for recommendations anyway, so this is another step that should have a much bigger impact on strengthening people\u2019s privacy than it will have on our business. Our stance on data localization is a risk. That is, if we get blocked in a major country, that will hurt our community and our business. But our principles on data localization aren\u2019t new and this is always a risk.","595":"Some people have asked whether more use of private social platforms will replace the more public platforms. And our privacy road map applies to all our products, but we believe there needs to continue to be both the digital town square and the digital living room. As private platforms have grown, in some cases, we\u2019ve seen some cannibalization of the more public platforms in countries like India, where WhatsApp is very popular, but the broader pattern across the world is that people want to use both private and public platforms . So, I believe building out this private social platform is a much greater opportunity than it is a risk.","596":"In thinking about the opportunity and impact to our business, by far the most important factor will be whether people choose to use our products and whether we can build the leading private social platforms in most countries. Now remember, we are not currently the leading messaging platform in either the United States, China, or Japan, which are the three largest economies in the world. Our apps aren\u2019t in China, but innovating and succeeding in the other countries is going to be very important. People want a private social platform that is as strong on privacy as possible, so delivering this is both in the interest of our community and our business.","597":"As always, our first step is going to be to focus on building the services people want. We\u2019re still in the early stages of developing this, and we\u2019ll share more as our plans develop. The other piece I published in the last month was about the four areas of internet regulation I think would be most helpful around content, elections, privacy, and data portability.","598":"And the reason I wrote this is because I\u2019ve spent most of the last couple of years focused on addressing the important social issues around the internet, and while I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, these are areas, where it doesn\u2019t feel right for a private company to make such important policy decisions by ourselves. If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I don\u2019t think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections, and data privacy without a more robust democratic process.","599":"For harmful content, I think there should be a public process for determining what\u2019s allowed and required for keeping harmful content to a minimum. That could be through government or industry, but having common standards is critical since people use so many different services to share content.","600":"For elections, there have long been laws defining what is political advertising, but we need to update those regulations to reflect today\u2019s threats like the ways that foreign nation states try to interfere in elections now. Those threats are often not covered by today\u2019s laws, and I think we\u2019d be better off if companies didn\u2019t define those policies themselves.","601":"For privacy, I believe it would be positive if more countries adopted regulation like GDPR as a common framework. At this point, realistically, most countries will adopt privacy regulation, and the most likely alternative to a global framework like GDPR is the fragmentation of the internet and more countries following the approach of authoritarian regimes adopting strict data localization policies, where governments can more easily access people\u2019s data, and I\u2019m highly concerned about that future.","602":"For data portability, if you have data in one service, you should be able to move it to another. But we need a common understanding of nuanced questions like what is your data and what is someone else\u2019s. If I share my birthday with you, is that now your data that you should be able to bring to your calendar app, so it can remind you later? Or is that only my data? And if a platform like Facebook facilitates data portability and you\u2019re bringing data to another app, whose responsibility is it if that app misuses your data? The absence of clear rules here discourages companies like ours from building tools to make it easier to move data between apps.","603":"These questions involve difficult tradeoffs. We can\u2019t have complete free speech, but no hate. We can\u2019t have complete privacy while also stopping every safety threat. We can\u2019t tell platforms to keep everyone\u2019s data private, but then expect a broad definition of data portability for research or competition. The values and equities at stake are too important and too conflicting for any company to balance them in a way that everyone will be comfortable with. So part of building trust will be deferring to a public process on how to make these tradeoffs.","604":"Dave Wehner \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","605":"I understand that any regulation may hurt our business. But I think it\u2019s necessary. Getting these issues right is more important than our interests. And I believe that regulation will help establish trust when people know that the right systems of governance and accountability are in place. So, over the long-term, I believe that that increase in the trustworthiness of the internet can have a much larger positive impact for our community and our business than any short-term hit that we\u2019re going to take.","606":"Overall, this is an important time for Facebook. I\u2019m excited about the direction we\u2019re heading and looking forward to discussing how we should address some of these issues more directly.","607":"As always, thank you for being on this journey with us. And now here\u2019s Sheryl to talk about our business.","608":"Sheryl Sandberg","609":"Thanks Mark, and hi everyone.","610":"We had a strong start to the year. Mobile ad revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $13.9 billion, making up approximately 93% of our total ad revenue. We had solid growth across all regions, and our revenue base continues to broaden as more businesses advertise with us. In Q1, our top 100 advertisers represented less than 20% of our total ad revenue, which means our advertiser base is more diverse compared to the same period last year.","611":"We\u2019re making significant investments in safety and security while continuing to grow our community and our business. This quarter once again, shows that we can do both. As we prepare to build more services around our privacy roadmap, we\u2019re changing the way we run the company. We are committed to earning back trust through the actions we take.","612":"A key part of earning back trust is increasing transparency. That starts with our products, which should be as easy to understand as they are to use. Last month, we updated our \u201cWhy am I seeing this ad?\u201d feature to give people more context and control over the ads they see. We also introduced \u201cWhy am I seeing this post?\u201d so people can learn more about what shows up in their News Feed and change their preferences to make their Facebook experience more personal.","613":"We are dramatically increasing transparency in our work on elections, where we\u2019re focused on addressing known threats and anticipating new ones. We built up our defenses for the U.S. midterms, and we\u2019re doing the same in other parts of the world. We\u2019ve expanded our Ads Library to include all ads, not just electoral ads and we\u2019ve made it easier to search for and report bad ads. Ahead of the European Parliament elections next month, anyone running political or issue ads in the EU is required to confirm their identity and location and include a \u201cpaid for by\u201d disclosure. Making online ads more transparent helps people understand who\u2019s trying to influence their vote, and helps us better defend against foreign interference.","614":"We\u2019re also working hard to ensure that our ads don\u2019t exclude or harm people. There\u2019s a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and we don\u2019t want this happening on Facebook. In March, we announced industry-leading changes, anyone running ads in these categories in the U.S. will no longer be allowed to target by age, gender, or zip code. We\u2019re also creating a new library, where people can search through active housing ads and report them. We expect these changes will affect some advertisers\u2019 ability to run legitimate ads, but we believe this is the right tradeoff to better protect against discrimination.","615":"Conference Call Participants","616":"Going forward, we will continue making investments to increase transparency, protect our platform from interference, and help keep people safe. We\u2019re doing this, because it\u2019s the right thing to do for people, and because it\u2019s good for our business over the long-term. At the same time, we are focused on continuing to grow our business by helping advertisers grow theirs. We offer the unique ability for advertisers to reach the right person with the right message at the right time, and for people to see ads that are truly relevant to them. We do this in a privacy-focused way that enables millions of businesses around the world to grow and hire.","617":"Facebook and Instagram Feed ads make up the bulk of our business today. We expect that to continue, but Stories are an increasingly important growth opportunity. We are helping advertisers keep up with the shift in how people are sharing, just as we did with mobile. We\u2019re proud to announce that we now have 3 million advertisers using Stories Ads to reach customers across Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger.","618":"Now, we\u2019ve learned it\u2019s not enough to make a new format available. We also need to make it easy for advertisers to optimize their campaigns. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with Stories. Last month, we introduced Interactive Stories Ads globally on Instagram. People and businesses already use interactive features to start conversations in their Stories and now advertisers can use polling stickers to stand out and drive results. When Dunkin\u2019 promoted its donut fries with an interactive poll in their Stories ads, more than one in five people, who saw the ad voted, which increased engagement and drove 20% lower cost per video view.","619":"In addition to helping advertisers make the shift to new ads experiences, we\u2019re making it easier for people to shop directly on our apps. We recently announced Checkout on Instagram, so when people find a product they love in a post or story, they can buy it without leaving the app. We launched with 23 brands in the U.S. including adidas and MAC. While this is a very small closed beta and we know this will take a long time to develop, we\u2019re excited about this next step for shopping on Instagram.","620":"Commerce is a growing area for us, too. We\u2019re seeing millions of interactions between buyers and sellers in Marketplace every day. Last quarter we expanded Marketplace ads to more countries and are seeing positive early results. For example, Succulents Box, an online subscription plant business, generates 18% of its total sales from their listings on Marketplace.","621":"As we continue to make ads and commerce better, we're focused on helping advertisers connect directly with people. In Q1, we launched Collaborative Ads, which give brands that don't have a direct-to-consumer channel a way to run e-commerce campaigns with retailers. Samsung recently tested Collaborative Ads with Fravega, an electronics retailer in Argentina. They targeted broad audiences who had viewed Samsung products on the retailer\u2019s website, and the campaign resulted in a 21% lift in sales.","622":"I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world. Every day, they give us valuable feedback on how to improve our products so that we can help them grow their businesses.","623":"I also want to thank the Facebook teams who drive that growth, while also making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company. I am grateful for my colleagues\u2019 continued dedication and hard work.","624":"Thanks, and here\u2019s Dave.","625":"Dave Wehner","626":"Doug Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","627":"Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Let\u2019s begin with our community metrics. Facebook daily active users reached 1.56 billion, up 8% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This represents approximately 66% of the 2.38 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew 179 million or 8% compared to last year.","628":"Turning to our Family metrics. We estimate that on average, over 2.1 billion people used at least one of our apps on a daily basis in March and around 2.7 billion people were active on a monthly basis. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services.","629":"Turning now to the financials. All of the comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.","630":"Q1 total revenue was $15.1 billion, up 26% or 30% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the first quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $503 million higher.","631":"Q1 total ad revenue was $14.9 billion, up 26% or 31% on a constant currency basis.","632":"In terms of regional ad revenue growth, U.S. and Canada was strongest at 30%, followed by Asia-Pacific at 28% and Rest of World at 23%. Europe grew more slowly at 21% and was impacted in part by currency headwinds.","633":"In Q1, the average price per ad decreased 4% and the number of ad impressions served across our services increased 32%. Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed, and Facebook News Feed. The year-over-year decline in average price per ad reflects an ongoing mix shift towards Stories ads and geographies that monetize at lower rates.","634":"Payments and Other Fees revenue was $165 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 40% from Q4 which benefitted from holiday sales of Oculus and Portal.","635":"Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $11.8 billion, up 80%. This includes a $3 billion accrual taken in connection with the inquiry of the Federal Trade Commission into our platform and user data practices. This matter remains unresolved, and we estimate that the associated range of loss is between $3 billion and $5 billion. Absent this accrual our total expense growth rate would have been 46 percentage points lower.","636":"We ended Q1 with approximately 37,700 full-time employees, up 36%.","637":"Brian Nowak \u2013 Morgan Stanley","638":"Operating income was $3.3 billion representing a 22% operating margin. Absent the accrual, operating margin would have been 20 percentage points higher.","639":"Our Q1 tax rate was 30% and was higher than the mid-teens guidance given the tax treatment of the accrual.","640":"Net income was $2.4 billion, or $0.85 per share. The accrual we recorded reduced EPS by approximately $1.04.","641":"Capital expenditures were $4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow and ended Q1 with approximately $45.2 billion in cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back approximately $521 million of our Class A common stock.","642":"Turning now to the revenue outlook. We continue to expect that our revenue growth rates will decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant currency basis. In addition, we anticipate ad targeting related headwinds will be more pronounced in the second half of 2019.","643":"Turning now to the expense outlook. We are adjusting our expense outlook which now includes the accrual we recorded in Q1. We now anticipate full-year 2019 total expenses to grow 47% to 55% compared to 2018, up from our prior guidance of 40% to 50% growth. The $3 billion accrual accounts for approximately 10 percentage points of the anticipated expense growth.","644":"But excluding the accrual, this revised outlook implies a modest adjustment in our guidance on 2019 core expense growth rate.","645":"Note that this does not change our longer-term outlook on the need to invest in core product, infrastructure, innovation, and safety and security, and the ultimate impact of those investments on our operating margin.","646":"We are updating our 2019 capital expenditures outlook to be $17 billion to $19 billion, down from our prior estimate of $18 billion to $20 billion. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our continued investment in data centers and servers.","647":"We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of 2019 to be in the mid-teens.","648":"Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","649":"In summary, Q1 was another good quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with our ability to grow our community and business while at the same time investing heavily for the future.","650":"With that, Mike, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.","651":"Question-and-Answer Session","652":"Operator","653":"We will now open the lines for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.","654":"Doug Anmuth","655":"Thanks for taking the question. Mark, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the time frame for building out a privacy-focused social platform? Are we thinking about one year, three years, five years, and what\u2019s the right way to think about that? And also how do you layer in additional services and functionality for users from there as you go along? And then one for Sheryl as well around Stories ads, you mentioned 3 million-plus advertisers, can you just talk about how the increased density there is translating into pricing relative to the feed? And your view over time, how Stories ads could monetize relative to feed ads? Thank you.","656":"Mark Zuckerberg","657":"Sure. For the time frame for this, I think that this is going to be a central focus for the company for the next five years or longer. Parts of this, we already have a strong foundation on, where WhatsApp and Messenger are strong around the world. But in a lot of the most important countries for this like that \u2013 like I mentioned in the United States and Japan, we are not the leading private communication service today. So there, the most important thing that we need to do is get the basics right and make sure that we are providing, hands down, without any question in anyone\u2019s mind, the clear best service in those areas. So we\u2019ll talk about both of these things over \u2013 a lot over the coming months and the plan \u2013 I\u2019ll share a little bit more at F8 next week in terms of the product roadmap and what we expect to see on this. But some of the things we\u2019re also going to intentionally take a longer period of time than we might have previously in order to get safety right.","658":"So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private communication services to all be end-to-end encrypted, I was very clear that we\u2019re planning on taking at least a year to go consult with experts and governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this really well, right? Because there are really important safety and content issues in messaging and if we don\u2019t have the ability to see the content, we need to make sure we have different tools in place to handle that. And this is a different approach than we would\u2019ve taken a few years ago, right?","659":"Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (NYSE:","660":"Company Participants","661":"Arren Cyganovich - Citigroup","662":"Arren Cyganovich","663":"Yes. I get - I mean I understand the whole idea, but just in terms of the actual impacts on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There's going to be a modest drag down on yield, I'm assuming. And then what's your - what is the leverage level that - if you're just to pro forma that at the end of the quarter?","664":"Jonathan Lamm","665":"So the increase in leverage is a little bit under 0.2x in the context of just taking those assets and bringing them on balance sheet to the end of the quarter at 1.02. It'll bring us to about 1.2x just from a leverage impact. And you can look at the weighted average yield of our portfolio at cost is in the 9s on balance sheet and was 7.6% at the Senior Credit Fund. So you can blend that based on the $1.4 billion on balance sheet relative to the couple of hundred million that's coming on.","666":"Arren Cyganovich","667":"Okay. And then your incentive - I'm sorry. Go ahead.","668":"Jonathan Lamm","669":"No. I'm just saying, is that what you were looking for, Arren?","670":"Arren Cyganovich","671":"Yes. It's perfect. And then the incentive fees, zero in the fourth quarter but pretty low for the first quarter. I'm assuming that's kind of related to a high watermark look-back because of the NAV decline. That's also part of why you're over-earning for the past two quarters, right?","672":"Derek Hewett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","673":"Jonathan Lamm","674":"That is correct. So there is - there - and again, that speaks to the net investment income. We certainly over-earn the dividend through net investment income by having a high-quality portfolio of attractive income-earning assets. But when we do have marks in the portfolio, realized or unrealized, we're also not taking incentive fee, which serves to increase the net investment income.","675":"Arren Cyganovich","676":"Right. It's shareholder friendly, so I appreciate that. But I just wanted to make sure that was right. And then the last question, it's more of an industry question. But you have a 5% decline in your NAV year-over-year, everybody has credit hiccups now and then, so I completely get that. But when BDCs were kind of originally created, it was more of a mezz vehicle just kind of 10, 12 years ago. And you had the ability to get warranted pretty low costs usually whenever you're making these debt investments. And you have the ability to hopefully earn some of that NAV back through those equity investments because everybody is going to have a credit hiccup here and there. Is there any way now that you can actually earn back those lost values in NAV? It's not - it's a question for you, but it's really a question for the industry as well.","677":"Jon Yoder","678":"Yes. I mean so look, I think it - unfortunately, the answer is it's hard to answer on an industry-wide basis because it really depends on the skill of the manager and the decisions they make as part of the restructuring of investments that they're taking losses on. So - and in particular, I think the question is if you're - hopefully, if you're skilled and you've done your job correctly, you come out of any restructuring with a claim and ownership stake or some other type of investment claim on that company so that if and when that company fixes the issues that caused the financial underperformance, you hold on to value that can increase to return your capital and possibly and then some, right?","679":"And so I think if you're solely the manager or you did your underwriting less properly to give yourself fewer rights in this [indiscernible] with no claim on the company whatsoever, like literally you've been wiped out and there's no further claim that you have. So if you look at, for example, the way that - if you look at the situations that have underperformed over the history of our investments, thankfully, by numerosity, it's not a huge number. But most importantly, to us, in virtually - in almost every case, we've retained an ownership stake or a claim on the company so that as, as I say, the problems that whatever - that were causing that financial underperformance get worked out, if they get worked, of course, we have the opportunity to recover our capital and possibly more.","680":"And so there's a lot of hard work that goes into that. We spend a lot of time with those companies, as you can imagine. Brendan mentioned in his opening remarks that there's nothing more important when you're a lender than focusing on the situation that underperformed. That's kind of the health sign in credit, if you will, is recovering the downside scenario. And so we spend a lot of time on that, and it's a lot of hard work. But it means that we do have the ability to recover the - at least the potential to recover those losses going forward. And again, that's us. It's case by case depending on, as I say, the skill of the manager.","681":"Brendan McGovern","682":"I think maybe to your industry question, I think actually if you look at the industry over a longer period of time, you alluded to the historical model of maybe some mezz with warrants and that being a source of upside, I think if you look at the NAV that has been created, it's more generally been sort of on a scale basis through things that are a bit more strategic using a premium currency, for example, in the context of M&A or an equity offering. I think that's why you see us as a management team focusing on things that are going to be shareholder friendly, that will continue to produce attractive net investment income and therefore a good, stable dividend performance in that context. And so that's something that we regard jealously as something that is an asset for us that can be utilized thoughtfully. I think there's ways to abuse it and therefore lose it. And we've been thoughtful about not doing those sorts of things. But I think when you do look at the industry, more of that NAV creation has been formed through those types of strategic transactions as opposed to the nominal pending work.","683":"Operator","684":"Operator","685":"And your next question comes from the line of Derek Hewett from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","686":"Derek Hewett","687":"Most of my questions were already asked and answered, but maybe if I will, are there any onetime items associated with the dissolution of the Senior Credit Fund?","688":"Jonathan Lamm","689":"There will be some write-off of some deferred financing expenses in the context of the dissolution and the repayment of a credit facility that we have there.","690":"Derek Hewett","691":"Okay. Could you quantify that?","692":"Jonathan Lamm","693":"About $2.5 million.","694":"Good morning. This is Ian, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","695":"Operator","696":"At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.","697":"Brendan McGovern","698":"Well, thank you, though, everybody, for joining us for the conference call. Of course, if you have any follow-on questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the team. I hope you enjoy a nice Mother's Day weekend. Thank you very much.","699":"Operator","700":"Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","701":"I will now turn the call over to Ms. Katherine Schneider, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs BDC. Katherine, you may begin your conference.","702":"Katherine Schneider","703":"Thanks, Ian. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin today's call, I would like to remind our listeners that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the company's control. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in the company's SEC filings.","704":"This audio cast is copyright material of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Yesterday, after the market closed, the company issued an earnings press release and posted a supplemental earnings presentation, both of which can be found on the homepage of our website at www.goldmansachsbdc.com under the Investor Resources section. These documents should be reviewed in conjunction with the company's Form 10-Q filing yesterday with the SEC.","705":"This conference call is being recorded today, May 10, 2019, for replay purposes.","706":"So with that, I'll turn the call over to Brendan McGovern, CEO of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.","707":"Katherine Schneider - VP, IR","708":"Brendan McGovern","709":"Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. As usual, in terms of the agenda for the call, I'll start by providing an overview of our first quarter results. From there, Jon Yoder will discuss our investment activity and portfolio metrics before handing it over to Jonathan Lamm to discuss our financial results in greater detail. And finally, I'll conclude with some closing remarks before opening the line for Q&A.","710":"So with that, net investment income per share was $0.55 in Q1, which equates to a 12.8% NII return on common equity. Our net investment income covered our dividend by 122% during the quarter, which is consistent with our long-term performance as a public company and reflects a combination of solid outperformance, coupled with a low operating expense structure.","711":"As we announced after close yesterday, our Board declared a $0.45 per share dividend payable to shareholders of record as of June 28, 2019. This equates to a dividend yield of 10.4% based on net asset value per share at the end of Q1. Gross and net originations during Q1 were $155.5 million and $77.7 million, respectively, primarily driven by gross originations of first lien debt investments.","712":"Over the past four quarters, following the passing of the Small Business Credit Availability Act, the company's proportion of first lien debt investments within its aggregate investment portfolio has increased by 74%, while second lien debt investments have decreased by 44%. In addition, single name portfolio diversification has increased by 39%. Subsequent to quarter end, we and our partner, Cal Regents, commenced the dissolution of our Senior Credit Fund joint venture. We set up this joint venture in 2014 for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, the JV allowed us to utilize our core competency in middle-market lending to originate lower-risk, lower-yielding, first lien investments by getting exposure to these loans in a structure that utilized leverage above the previous regulatory cap of 1:1. This combination produced attractive risk-adjusted returns since inception in the low double digits.","713":"In light of the reduction in the minimum asset coverage ratio now applicable to the company, we determined that the utility of the joint venture was diminished. Stated simply, the targeted debt-to-equity ratio that we had for the joint venture can now be achieved directly on balance sheet. As a result, effective May 8, the company received its pro-rata portion of the SCF investments, bringing these investments onto the company's balance sheet. Following this transaction, the company's first lien debt exposure and single name asset diversification has further increased. We believe this improves our overall asset mix, which in turn further strengthens the company's financing profile. Pro forma for the closing of this transaction and using the static exposures at the end of the quarter, there are 105 portfolio companies in our investment portfolio, and 67% of the fair market value of the book is in first lien debt investments.","714":"Also during the quarter, we increased both the number of lenders in our credit facility as well as the total commitment size to $795 million with no change to the coupon rate.","715":"The restructuring of our joint venture and subsequent increase in debt capacity are the latest in a series of actions that we have taken over the last year to optimize our balance sheet and deliver the benefits of the Small Business Credit Availability Act to shareholders. We are pleased with the results thus far, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to capture additional benefits in the months and quarters to come. Finally, recall that on last quarter's earnings conference call in March and in the subsequent events portion of our 10-K filing, we made significant disclosures about our investment in Animal Supply. Specifically, we reported that after year-end, we closed on the restructuring of this investment. As we described in that disclosure, there was a mark-down this quarter in Q1 as a result of the transaction. This mark was the largest driver of the NAV decline this quarter.","716":"From here, the company maintains a significant equity stake in Animal Supply, and thus far, we are encouraged by the stability of recent financial performance, but we are mindful that significant work remains to optimize the outcome of this investment. To that end, we have dedicated substantial resources to this investment and are working closely with management. We know that as credit investors, improving outcomes for underperforming investments is a critical success factor. We remain laser-focused on this effort on behalf of our investors.","717":"With that, let me turn it over to Jon Yoder.","718":"Brendan McGovern - President & CEO","719":"Jon Yoder","720":"All right. Thanks, Brendan. During the quarter, we witnessed broader market stabilization following the increased volatility that occurred in the markets during the fourth quarter. Within the middle market, overall loan volume was lower than historical averages. Given this context, we were pleased with our first quarter activity levels, which were actually a bit higher across our platform as compared with Q1 of 2018. Thematically, we continue to be focused on more senior investments in first lien parts of the capital structure.","721":"Origination this quarter included a mix of new and follow-on investments to existing portfolio companies, and we continue to have success in both sponsored deals as well as deals to family and founder-owned businesses referred through our private wealth channel. This quarter, one of the new investments that we originated resulted from a private wealth relationship, which began with the CEO of a technology consulting firm that specializes in digital transformation for Fortune 500 companies. This CEO decided to sell a portion of his company to a Tier 1 private equity firm. But given the relationship, trust and partnership that we had cultivated with the CEO over the years, we were able to help structure and lead the lending facility. We believe that this investment is a good example of the importance of a strong origination network to find attractive deals even during the competitive environment we are currently experiencing.","722":"So turning to specific investment activity for the quarter. New investment commitments and fundings were $155.5 million and $124.9 million, respectively. Regarding placement in the capital structure, new originations this quarter were comprised of 82% first lien loans, 6% second lien loans and 12% in preferred stock. These new investment commitments were across seven new portfolio companies and four existing portfolio companies.","723":"Sales and repayment activity totaled $77.8 million driven primarily by the full repayment of two investments in two different portfolio companies, both of which were second lien investments that produced very attractive IRRs to our investors.","724":"As a result of our origination shift in the first lien investments and when coupled with sales and repayment activity that has occurred within our second lien investment portfolio, we have meaningfully increased the company's exposure in first lien investments over the trailing 12 months. At the end of the first quarter 2019, first lien exposure was 58% of the portfolio as compared to 33% at the end of last - the first quarter of last year. Our second lien exposure was reduced from 37% to 21% of the total portfolio over the same time period. As Brendan mentioned, the unwinding of our Senior Credit Fund joint venture partnership closed this week. This transaction resulted in the company obtaining its pro-rata portion of the Senior Credit Fund investments onto the company's balance sheet. And as a result of this transaction, first lien investments have increased to 67% of the total investment portfolio using the March 31 ending valuations.","725":"The weighted average yield of our investment portfolio at cost at the end of the first quarter was 9.3% as compared to 9.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. The weighted average yield of our total debt and income-producing investments at cost was 10.7% at the end of the first quarter as compared to 10.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. Regarding portfolio composition. As of the end of the quarter, total investments in our portfolio were $1,405.1 million at fair value comprised of 85.9% senior secured loans, including 58% in first lien, 7.2% in first lien\/last-out unitranche and 20.7% in second lien debt, as well as 0.5% in unsecured debt, 6.8% in preferred and common equity and 6.8% in the Senior Credit Fund.","726":"We also had $124.8 million of unfunded commitments as of March 31, bringing total investments and commitments to $1,529.9 million. As of the end of the quarter, the company had 148 investments across 78 portfolio companies operating in 33 different industries. So turning to credit quality. The underlying performance of the majority of our portfolio companies was stable quarter-over-quarter. In fact, the weighted average net debt to EBITDA of the companies in our investment portfolio was 5.3x at quarter end, down from 5.6x at the end of the fourth quarter. The weighted average interest coverage of the company's non-investment portfolio at quarter end was 2.2x, which was unchanged from the prior quarter.","727":"So I will now turn the call over to Jonathan to walk through our financial results.","728":"Jonathan Lamm","729":"Jon Yoder - COO","730":"Thanks, Jon. We ended the first quarter of 2019 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $1.405 billion, outstanding debt of $709 million and net assets of $695 million. Our net investment income per share was $0.55 as compared to $0.56 in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.06 as compared to negative $0.03 in the prior quarter. During the quarter, our average debt-to-equity ratio was 0.98x versus 0.9x in the prior quarter. We ended the first quarter with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.02x versus 0.94x at the end of Q4.","731":"We are pleased with the gradual growth of our balance sheet this quarter into additional attractive income-producing assets. As we discussed in prior quarters, our utilization of higher balance sheet leverage will be dictated by asset composition. This is a reflection of prudent risk management practices, which we believe are core competency of Goldman Sachs. We will seek to maintain a meaningful cushion relative to the regulatory asset coverage requirement as we have done historically. Turning to the income statement. Our total investment income for the first quarter was $36.5 million, which was up from $36 million last quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily driven by an increase in prepayment fees and accelerated accretion.","732":"Total expenses were $13.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $13 million in the prior quarter. Expenses were up quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by an increase in incentive fees and an increase in interest expenses due to higher average daily borrowings during the quarter. Now it was down quarter-over-quarter, we ended Q1 with net asset value per share at $17.25 versus $17.65 in the prior quarter. The largest driver in our NAV decline came from our investment in Animal Supply, which we disclosed last quarter. Our supplemental earnings presentation provides a NAV bridge to walk you through the changes from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The company had $46 million in accumulated undistributed net investment at quarter end resulting from net investment income that has consistently exceeded our dividend. This equates to $1.14 per share on current shares outstanding.","733":"During the first quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $795 million, up from $695 million. We were pleased with our ability to attract new lending counterparties into the facility. As of March 31, total debt commitments were $950 million, including the company's unsecured convertible debt. These debt commitments provide the company with ample capacity to continue to prudently grow the balance sheet.","734":"With that, I will turn it back to Brendan.","735":"Brendan McGovern","736":"Thanks, Jonathan. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, particularly as it pertains to the net investment income, which has exceeded our dividend. As always, we thank you for the privilege of managing your capital, and we look forward to continuing the hard work for you on behalf of you for the remainder of the year.","737":"With that, let's open up the line for questions.","738":"Question-and-Answer Session","739":"Operator","740":"Jonathan Lamm - Treasurer & CFO","741":"[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo.","742":"Finian O'Shea","743":"First on Country Fresh. The [indiscernible] this quarter. I know it's a second lien, so the - March can be very volatile. Can you kind of describe the sequential market this - or a function of the asset going on, on nonaccrual and being worked out potentially, helping us think about sort of the risk of second lien in that sense when you see something last quarter that was marked in the 70 range? Or was this a big sequential leg-down in the performance of that company?","744":"Jon Yoder","745":"Yes. So Jon here. First off, let me give some context. So our loan to Country Fresh is frankly a very small position in the portfolio. It was less than $10 million of invested capital compared to the $1.5 billion of total balance sheet investments. So little context there. But to give you a little color, it's a sponsor-backed company where - that processes and distributes fresh-cut fruits and vegetables to retailers. Our underwriting thesis when we made this loan was really centered on the large scale and national operational footprint of the company that we thought acted as a nice competitive advantage and a barrier to entry for competitors.","746":"We also saw strong industry growth trends. This company distributes predominantly to retailers who, because they're being increasingly held accountable for food - increased food safety regulations, they are choosing to outsource a lot of that fresh-cut fruit and other sort of food preparation to third parties.","747":"So in any event - and with outsourcing, of course, strong consumer demand for healthy, convenient food products, which was the underlying demand pull-through of the products that the company was processing and distributing. But regardless, during the course of 2018, certain performance issues started to emerge. Much of it was related to raw material and labor cost issues. But we were pleased that during the course of 2018, the sponsor, which had invested significant capital below our debt, continued to invest additional capital throughout 2018. That being said, we did - if you look at sort of our marks quarter-over-quarter over the course of 2018, we were marking down the position to reflect what we thought was a prudent view of the increased risk of the position.","748":"In the first quarter of 2019 - and I guess this kind of gets the heart of your question of, obviously, there was a pretty big move from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in the mark. In the first quarter of 2019, we became aware of some significant liquidity concerns at the company that really prompted both the first lien and second lien lender groups to start focusing on a restructuring. And you were right in asking or suggesting that this happened very quickly. It definitely did happen quite quickly given sort of the updated liquidity situation and frankly some updated information that we got about the company at the end of the fourth - about 2018 results. In the first quarter, we moved quickly with other lenders to focus on restructuring. And so we have marked the position down to reflect kind of a view given the new information that we got during the first quarter. I will say that subsequent to the quarter end, we have now completed a restructuring of the position. And we think that the company, that the position that - the mark that we had at the end of the first quarter, obviously we're still in the midst of the second quarter, so we can't say with any degree of uncertainty as to exactly where the mark on this position will be as we get to the end of the second quarter. But suffice to say, as you can see, in dollar amounts, it's very small even at the end of the first quarter, so any changes in the second quarter are likely to be quite insignificant.","749":"So that's kind of the long and short of that. I mean I would certainly characterize this as a particularly fast-moving, fast-changing situation. And it's not that common that a situation like this arises. Obviously, it happens from time to time. But the speed at which this company sort of started to underperform or at least information came to light about the underperformance was far more rapid than what we normally see in our portfolio companies. So that's the - pretty much the color I can give.","750":"Finian O'Shea","751":"Conference Call Participants","752":"I appreciate that color. And then just one more, if I may. Seeking your commentary generally on the news we see of your parent's bank, although, of course, you're a distinct entity and they're a '40 Act fund and so forth. But on the bank side, it looks like the streamlining of other businesses not so far afield to what you're doing, streamlining and according to the journal and such, looking more like an alternatives business. Anything at all to see in a change of how they might operate closer to you? Or any discussion of how you fit into this picture that would be helpful to know? Or is it continual - a continuing that you each operate in your respective lines?","753":"Brendan McGovern","754":"Yes. I'll take a crack, Fin. So certainly, no news or no real changes within our group and organization. Certainly, anytime we've got a new CEO, there is going to be a desire to take a look at businesses and look for ways to improve and enhance outcomes overall. But I think suffice to say, within our group, we've had a really good trajectory overall. And I think where we fit in the ecosystem is exactly where the firm is focused in terms of spending resources and trying to highlight its capabilities. So we don't foresee and don't anticipate any changes in the structure of our business that will be impacted in any way anything that might come to pass here.","755":"Operator","756":"And your next question comes from the line of Leslie Vandegrift from Raymond James.","757":"Leslie Vandegrift","758":"My first question is on the quarter, more so towards the beginning of the quarter with the disruption from the end of 2018 kind of spilling over. Are any of the originations this quarter more opportunistic deals that you got into because of that disruption?","759":"Jon Yoder","760":"Yes. I mean - so Leslie, I would say not really. I think that there - if you look at what we did - what we do and what we - kind of our approach to investing here, I would say on the asset side of our balance sheet, we are - I wouldn't call us as people that are focused on \"opportunistic investments.\" I think we have a point of view that the middle market is a place that nonbank lenders are going to thrive and are needed as fundamental elements of the ecosystem. And so we focus on optimizing kind of our ability to find the best deals in that market versus sort of scanning for other ancillary investment strategies that we might be able to bring into the portfolio.","761":"I would say as we think about - we probably are a bit more opportunistic on the right side of our balance sheet. We try to pick our spots as to when we find financing and the types of financings that we're looking at. So we are certainly always scanning for opportunities or opportunistic situations to pursue financing arrangements. But on the left-hand side, as I say, we have a view that fundamentally, we have a strong place in the ecosystem of middle market lending, and that's where we want to continue to keep our focus.","762":"Finian O'Shea - Wells Fargo Securities","763":"Brendan McGovern","764":"Yes. Leslie, it's Brendan here. The only thing I'd add is when you think about those - in the context of capital markets disruption, oftentimes the \"opportunistic transaction\" is stepping into the shoes of a deal that has been perhaps structured aggressively or underwritten in a way that one might not be comfortable with. Structure, in particular, becomes important in the documentation of the loans. And so rather than trying to define the right price to pay for a deal that might not have the attributes that we prefer to have. I think what you saw this quarter was the ability to execute within a market environment where certainty of private credit really comes to the floor, but doing deals that were underwritten in a traditional way, par lending for deals that we've been focusing on for quite some time in the middle market in particular. I would say another attribute oftentimes in those more opportunistic deals as they do tend to be bigger companies, bigger capital structures where deals might be straddling the syndication market. And so our preference continues to be the focus on the heart of the middle market. I think that's what you've seen us do this quarter.","765":"Leslie Vandegrift","766":"Okay. And then on the - and the press release discusses the weighted average EBITDA and the incremental decrease from last quarter. Is that driven by the mix in companies that - size-wise, that originated versus the exit? Or is that because the existing portfolio companies had a pullback in EBITDA in the quarter?","767":"Jon Yoder","768":"It's the former. So it's just a matter of mix in terms of the companies that we are originating loans to versus the ones that left the portfolio. It's not been driven by declines in EBITDA of our portfolio companies.","769":"Leslie Vandegrift","770":"Okay. And then just the last question. On NTS, are you still expecting the timing of that close to be towards the end of this quarter?","771":"Jon Yoder","772":"Yes. I mean - so yes, although I mean I would - we - I wouldn't necessarily anchor you to that or anybody to that. I mean I think we're making our best guesses as to when that deal is going to close. But certainly, there are a number - it's largely outside of our control. Just to refresh everybody's memory, NTS is a deal that we're - it's a company that's been acquired, and as part of that acquisition, our debt - we'll receive a return for our debt. The deal is contingent as all telecom deals are on getting approval from the FCC to transfer the licenses to operate the telecommunications system that, in this case, NTS owns. And so you're literally waiting for the FCC to finish its review of the transaction and the application to transfer licenses, and the FCC can work on its own timeline, quite frankly. But just based on historical precedent and what we have seen and what our advisers have told us as to what is a reasonable time frame to expect that review to be concluded, we have been projecting sometime around the end of the second quarter. It is definitely possible it could slip into the third quarter, there's no assurances given. But we think - we certainly think we're closer to getting - or hopeful that we're closer to getting that approval today than we were when the transaction was announced late last year. So that's a little bit of color there.","773":"Leslie Vandegrift - Raymond James & Associates","774":"Operator","775":"And our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","776":"Michael Ramirez","777":"This is Michael Ramirez on for Mark. I guess just a follow-up on the - I guess the origination question previously. It looks like many of your public BDC peers have characterized this environment as remaining competitive. No big change from last few quarters. You mentioned this morning the overall deal volume has been lower than historical averages. We've both seen that with the data. But your new originations were greater than last year. So our question is what percentage of the deal that came across your desk this quarter did you close on compared to prior quarters? And if we can ask additionally, when you are passing on deals, what are some characteristics that you're trying to avoid? And how has this changed over time?","778":"Brendan McGovern","779":"Yes. I'll take a first crack in this multipart question, Jon, so you have some insights here as well. I think, Michael, in any given quarter, it's always hard to sort of define your own origination cadence versus the market. I think the observations that we described are - certainly are consistent, a slowing of market trends overall. But when you look at the size and scale of our platform in the company, we're one player here. In any given quarter, 1 or 2 deals can break one way or another such that your own trends are different than the broader market here. So there's certainly no change with respect to the hit ratio, if you will, of deals that we're closing on relative to the deals that we're seeing. If anything, one thing that you've heard us say consistently is we really try to focus on having a diversity of sources of opportunities coming in. We were successful again this quarter, as Jon described, leveraging our private wealth network where - what we think are, by definition, less competitive financing opportunities. So I think that kind of works on our favor in the context of competitive market environment.","780":"Your other question, I think, was around what's typically the nature of why we might lose a transaction in the course of a competitive environment. I think most often, it comes down to the terms that you're willing to offer. Oftentimes, the quantum of debt relative to the companies capable to service that I think becomes a key factor. I'm sure you've heard folks in the market describing, for example, there are concerns about adjusted EBITDA and the adjustments that are made. For us, in our platform, what we try to do is really be quite, quite disciplined around defining for ourselves what is an EBITDA that we can underwrite, and in the context of that number as opposed to a number that might be otherwise marketed to us, provide a solution that we're willing to offer. I would say there is one common scenario where we're not winning transactions because we're not willing to be as aggressive with respect to financing or underwriting an EBITDA that perhaps a different competitor might be.","781":"Jon Yoder","782":"Yes. And just to add onto that a little bit. I mean I think there's - in a sense you can think at an even higher level here. There's really two breaking points in terms of when you are calling your sort of funnel down to what you actually invest in. The first question is really is this a company that you want to finance. And then Brendan's commentary was around, okay, if you determine that something that - is a company that you'd like to finance, what are the reasons why you may choose not to go forward even if you like the underlying company. But the one - the bigger picture I do want to convey is by far, the biggest reason when companies go from the top of the funnel where an opportunity comes in and get to weed it out is because they don't pass sort of our credit metrics. And then if it does pass our kind of - our underwriting standards, then as Brendan was saying, we get into, well, is there a structure that we can get comfortable with that - and oftentimes - or sometimes at least, the reality is that other competitors will offer to do things that we wouldn't be comfortable with. But again, it all starts with fundamentally do we like this business and is it one that we think we're comfortable with and that whittles out the vast majority of the companies that come in at the sort of top of the funnel.","783":"Michael Ramirez","784":"Michael Ramirez - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","785":"That's helpful. One more, if we may. It seems that you guys have been sort of quite successful carrying the dividend over the last four quarters. I'm sure this question has been asked a few times over last year, so - but what metrics, thresholds do you need to exceed to be comfortable to raise your dividend? Any color on that, that would be helpful.","786":"Jonathan Lamm","787":"Yes. The over-earnings of the dividend is in the context of the historical portfolio, higher portfolio of yields. As we've transitioned the portfolio in more recent quarters to more first lien investments, you've seen our weighted average yield at cost come down. And we think that the over-earnings of the dividend can certainly continue, but we don't see a point in the context of what we're seeing in the market and our target leverage ratio where we think it makes sense to increase our dividend in terms of the fixed dividend. We do, as I mentioned, have the $1.14 of spillover income. At this point, we think it's advantageous to shareholders to continue to spill that over given where we trade and the cost of raising equity capital versus being able to spill it over for a nominal excise cost. But that's been our position and at this point continues to be.","788":"Operator","789":"And our next question is from the line of Arren Cyganovich from Citigroup.","790":"Arren Cyganovich","791":"Just starting off on the dissolution of your JV. Wondering if you could just talk about the pro forma impacts to your investment yield, to the cost of funds and to your leverage.","792":"Brendan McGovern","793":"Yes. We'll take a crack at the pro forma. I think when you look at what we're doing here, effectively today, as of the end of the quarter, what the company reflects is an equity investment in a leveraged entity, and that historically has produced a dividend yield back on that equity investment, which has been attractive. And as we described I think at length, we can effectively now do that on balance sheet. So the pro forma impact will be that we'll basically swap that equity investment. That equity investment will go away off our balance sheet and we'll take back on the balance sheet. Those whole loans that were within that vehicle diversified portfolio of first lien loans, we schedule all those out within our Ks and Qs so you can see those.","794":"So the yield on those investments is nominally lower than what has historically been on balance sheet. But of course, we can now finance those assets on balance sheet at the same target leverage, which will end up producing the same type of overall return to the company. And most importantly, when you step back and look at what the new business looks like, there's a simplicity to the balance sheet, which is just a portfolio of whole loans that we believe is attractive to financing providers. So said quite frankly, the notion of financing a leveraged equity, an acquisition in a leveraged vehicle, not that attractive to lots of folks, but with whole loans, especially first lien loans, is quite attractive. So we think certainly over time, that helps lower the cost of financing for our vehicle, which, of course, has a benefit of enhancing the net returns that we can earn for the company.","795":"The Kroger Co. (NYSE:","796":"Company Participants","797":"John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","798":"Judah Frommer","799":"Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just a follow-up on IDs. Can you help us with the cadence throughout the quarter? It sounded like when you gave the quarter-to-date update with fourth quarter earnings that you were running better than where you finished the quarter and obviously things are expected to accelerate. So beyond remodels, have there been enough contribution from the roll-out of online grocery and the impact of inflation relative to your expectations? ","800":"W. Rodney McMullen","801":"Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make \u2013 tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a lull, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything, but there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of \u2013 if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all of those things. ","802":"As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind, but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth, and if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we\u2019re looking at the second quarter so far, it's only three weeks, but we are moving closer to the 2019 guidance. ","803":"Gary Millerchip","804":"Rodney, the only thing I would add \u2013 the question was asked around digital too as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. ","805":"Judah Frommer","806":"Okay. And if I could quickly follow up on media, it sounds like trends are going kind of in line with or above plan there. Clearly some of your big box competitors have made moves in the media space, sometimes acquiring external assets. Is that something you feel like you need to do? Does their leaning into these retailer-led platforms help your conversations with vendors, or does it serve as more competition? ","807":"W. Rodney McMullen","808":"Michael Lasser - UBS","809":"For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand, and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer.","810":"And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced for all of us to be successful just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. ","811":"In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now, whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. ","812":"Judah Frommer","813":"Great. Thanks. ","814":"Operator","815":"The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","816":"Edward Kelly","817":"Yeah, hi, guys. Just first, a clarification. The planned real estate transaction in the quarter, if I look at the cash flow statement there is about a $57 million gain. Is that the amount that we should be thinking about that contributed to the quarter? ","818":"Gary Millerchip","819":"Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","820":"Hi. Yes. This is Gary. That's right, Ed. As we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. ","821":"So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often there can be some losses as well as a gain sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that one-time transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. ","822":"Edward Kelly","823":"Any other planned real estate transactions like this contemplated for the full year? ","824":"Gary Millerchip","825":"I think we're always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist. But they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. ","826":"W. Rodney McMullen","827":"And Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, in the guidance. ","828":"Edward Kelly","829":"Rodney, my real question here is for you, and it's on the IDs. And bigger picture, you used to consistently outperform a broader peer set and industry data like Nielsen. And to me, one of the biggest issues right now with your company is that that actually no longer seems to be happening. Your IDs are just north of 1% this quarter, despite the fact that you have digital in there. Specialty is in there now. You are lapping some optimization. You invested a lot last year. ","830":"Chris Prykull - Goldman Sachs","831":"I guess why do you think the share gains have slowed so much? And I know you're focused on improving momentum, but what specific adjustments are you making? ","832":"W. Rodney McMullen","833":"It really is for us to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. So part of the \u2013 and this is using the data that we track every week. How are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock, and all of those pieces, and the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. ","834":"The other part is some of the things I mentioned before. It's just cycling, space optimization, and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing, and using the data in a continued sophisticated way but even growing upon that is what we've had in the past. ","835":"Edward Kelly","836":"All right. Thanks, guys. ","837":"W. Rodney McMullen","838":"Thanks, Edward. ","839":"Operator","840":"The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","841":"Michael Montani - Evercore ISI","842":"Rupesh Parikh","843":"Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I actually wanted to touch on food inflation. Could you maybe give a little bit more granular in terms of what you're seeing currently and your expectations going forward? And then maybe you can talk about, are you seeing prices being passed through to the shelf at this point? ","844":"W. Rodney McMullen","845":"Sure, I'll be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we would see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%, that is what we built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. ","846":"Certainly as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. ","847":"One of the things we obviously feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through, and of course it's a great set of knowledge for us, knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increase. ","848":"Rupesh Parikh","849":"Okay. That's helpful. Oh, no. Keep going. ","850":"W. Rodney McMullen","851":"I was saying, I think our outlook for the year in general would be similar to what we've been experiencing except for of course some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously one or two items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. ","852":"Operator","853":"Yeah, and tariffs from China is a pretty minimal effect on us and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully something works out there. As you know, overall from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. ","854":"Rupesh Parikh","855":"Okay. That's great additional color. And then just quickly on gross margins, can you talk about the dynamics going on with pharmacy right now in the industry as relates to gross margin and how you're thinking about kind of those dynamics going forward? ","856":"Gary Millerchip","857":"Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context in pharmacy business too because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty with the customer and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly as we mentioned during the quarter, and it ties very closely to us to our health and wellness strategy and as we start to think about food as medicine we think it's a very important connection. ","858":"The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play really within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1, which as I mentioned wouldn't be unique to us. ","859":"The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore, the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PBM agreements, three of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in cost there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. ","860":"That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that both from a how to do we buy most effectively but also how do create more efficiency in the pharmacy business, and we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. ","861":"W. Rodney McMullen","862":"And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our own brands and other things that I mentioned in total we still had great results. And also, as we move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an Alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life.","863":"Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. ","864":"And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. ","865":"Rupesh Parikh","866":"Okay. Great. Thank you so much. ","867":"W. Rodney McMullen","868":"Thank you.","869":"Operator","870":"The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","871":"John Heinbockel","872":"Hey, Rodney, can you address the topic of the organization's capacity for change, right. So you've got a lot of change going on. You've got people in new roles. Do you think that \u2013 all of that, other than maybe space optimization, is impacting execution in any way and it may be impacting your top-line growth? ","873":"And then as you go forward, if there might be some of that, is there a way to sort of streamline things, prioritize so that maybe there is \u2013 you impact the organization's ability to manage that change better? Curious your thoughts on that. ","874":"I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","875":"W. Rodney McMullen","876":"Yeah, a great question, John, and it's something that we talk about obviously routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving Alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had \u2013 it's a huge opportunity, we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to \u2013 for us to ask ourselves, is it center of plate or corner of plate and if it's center, that's incredibly important. ","877":"So I feel incredibly good about the people that we put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help supplement the internal talent we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents, and on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. ","878":"So to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people enroll over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes and it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth. ","879":"So it\u2019s making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. ","880":"John Heinbockel","881":"And then I know it's early, but what have you learned with the Walgreen test in Cincinnati, particularly as you kind of look forward to opening up the Ocado sheds in non-Kroger markets? Have you learned anything definitive, or not yet? ","882":"W. Rodney McMullen","883":"It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been an incredibly positive is Walgreens. Their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner, and both of us are learning things that customer likes and dislike together and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. ","884":"And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. ","885":"Rebekah Manis","886":"Gary Millerchip","887":"Yeah, sure. I think some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky alongside 10 of our own stores with the pick-up service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're a different level of convenience than we were before and this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. ","888":"We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight whether it's for lunch or dinner and that's certainly a real positive. ","889":"What we find generally with the small format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with the shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small format stores and we\u2019ve seen that over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really pouring over the data and making sure that we're using a data driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. ","890":"John Heinbockel","891":"Okay. Thank you. ","892":"W. Rodney McMullen","893":"Thanks, John. ","894":"Operator","895":"The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. ","896":"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. ","897":"Michael Lasser","898":"Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you give us more clarity on how the past full year operating profit guidance works? Thus far, you're trending a little below your ID sales range, even currently in the current quarter.","899":"It sounds like the pharmacy gross margin pressure has been greater than you expected and you got a real estate gain in the first quarter, yet your profits were still down. So what's the path that you could take from here to get to your operating profit guidance for the full year? And at what point do you see more risk that it would be harder to get to that level? ","900":"W. Rodney McMullen","901":"Yeah, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the \u2013 if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the C-store business during the first quarter. And we sold YOU Tech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. ","902":"And as I mentioned, the Alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. ","903":"Gary Millerchip","904":"Yeah, it's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney. So thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where Alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. ","905":"I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and will continue to pull to give us the ability to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. ","906":"So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customers and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model and we continue to find additional opportunities whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in resale and cost of goods. As so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020.","907":"Rebekah Manis - Director, IR","908":"Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you. ","909":"Michael Lasser","910":"And then my follow-up question is on your price investment, recognizing that there\u2019s been a lot of noise in your IDs over the last couple of quarters, given the disruption from the store remodels. Do you think your price investments are as effective as they might have been in the past? And if they are, will you have to reaccelerate your price investments in the coming quarters to drive higher IDs from here? ","911":"W. Rodney McMullen","912":"One of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price. And we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they\u2019re looking at their price as well. ","913":"When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what\u2019s the experience they get from associates, what\u2019s the freshness of the fresh department, and we continue to rate strong in terms of if you look at produce, meat, seafood, deli, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. ","914":"And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then obviously fuel is an important part of that overall equation. ","915":"So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at, as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. ","916":"Michael Lasser","917":"Thank you very much, and good luck. ","918":"W. Rodney McMullen","919":"I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. ","920":"Thanks, Michael. ","921":"Operator","922":"The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","923":"Kelly Bania","924":"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. ","925":"W. Rodney McMullen","926":"Good morning.","927":"Kelly Bania","928":"Had a \u2013 good morning. Had a couple questions on operating profit. I first wanted to ask just about your three-year plan. I didn\u2019t really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don\u2019t want to read too much into it, but can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you\u2019ve pointed out in the past, I think the Street is skeptical of getting to that, given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? ","929":"And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill, and there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition, and now with this real estate transaction, that was $57 million I think. So that\u2019s about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren\u2019t aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? ","930":"W. Rodney McMullen","931":"W. Rodney McMullen","932":"Sure. Yeah, I think as you think about the Restock Kroger plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. ","933":"I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we\u2019re feeling very good about the \u2013 what we\u2019ve learned through the process around where we unlock and you how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you\u2019ve heard us talk about, Alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be. If anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there.","934":"As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying I would say more cost savings as we\u2019re working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there and becoming a more efficient operator. ","935":"I do think as we\u2019ve shared all the way along and Rodney\u2019s been consistent in his comments that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That\u2019s an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we\u2019re committed to achieve in the second half is this year and obviously into 2020. ","936":"So I think as you pull those three pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there and I would say in the levers that we intended to pull where we are in the journey with those levers, we\u2019re feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we\u2019re still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. ","937":"Kelly Bania","938":"And any comment on the Home Chef, Turkey Hill, the real estate, how those are part of the $400 million, the impact of those?","939":"W. Rodney McMullen","940":"Yeah, so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we\u2019re place lined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion in 2017, down to $3.5 billion. There may be a couple of \u2013 they\u2019re certainly not going to be drastic and material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that have happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. ","941":"Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.","942":"We certainly don\u2019t contemplate as we think about the run rate and the value that we\u2019ll be generating in 2020 the one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We\u2019re not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn\u2019t drive the value. ","943":"But the Home Chef certainly isn\u2019t in the $400 million. And the Turkey Hill sale gain certainly isn\u2019t included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are. That\u2019s why we kind of stripped those out from the performance and what which shared is our progress in the year. None of those or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain and that would be if you like filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. ","944":"Kelly Bania","945":"Okay. Maybe just a couple follow-ups to that. I guess can you share with us where you see your FIFO operating profit with all the adjustments, these I guess five quarters through the plan?","946":"And then in terms of Alternative profit, so I think you said in the past there was a 20% increase this year. Does that equate to the $100 million that you\u2019re now talking about, and can you remind us what the last year and next year is kind of planned at? ","947":"W. Rodney McMullen","948":"Well, on Alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was \u2013 last year was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at 2017, if I remember right, Gary, you\u2019ll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. ","949":"So it\u2019s continuing to accelerate as we learn how to do it. And if you look at like the media business, we\u2019ve recruited professionals that know how to grow that business. So we\u2019re actually accelerating where we are. On the five quarters and stuff, I think we\u2019re probably \u2013 it would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up and make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help \u2013 be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. ","950":"Kelly Bania","951":"Thank you. ","952":"We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan, Restock Kroger. ","953":"W. Rodney McMullen","954":"Thanks, Kelly.","955":"Operator","956":"The next question comes from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","957":"Chris Prykull","958":"Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. ","959":"W. Rodney McMullen","960":"Good morning. ","961":"Chris Prykull","962":"So I guess firstly on the composition of gross margin, the change year-over-year and maybe the cadence the rest of the year, a couple components to that. So how much of the 40 basis point nonfuel decline can be attributed to pharmacy? Should we expect a similar headwind for the rest of the year, or will that improve? You mentioned Alternative profits can be lumpy. Anything to keep in mind from a margin contribution seasonally? ","963":"All of this work starts with our customer obsession focus. That is why we're building an omni-channel platform to serve customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by exciting partnerships that create additional value. ","964":"And then you\u2019re lapping some supply chain investments in the fourth quarter. I understand that. Any sense for mix shift towards Our Brands and the contribution there? ","965":"W. Rodney McMullen","966":"I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019ll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan, and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. ","967":"If you look at Our Brands, I always tell people Our Brands margin typically is 600 basis points to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously it\u2019s a higher sales part and when you look at the gross margin per item, it\u2019s usually a penny or two higher on a cents per item profit basis. In terms of Rx in the balance of the year, Gary, I\u2019ll let you go into a little bit of the details there. ","968":"Gary Millerchip","969":"Yeah, so certainly as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned, and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth, those two combined would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. ","970":"We\u2019re feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year, and as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don\u2019t expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. ","971":"That being said, obviously we manage the business very dynamically. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re able to adapt on price and continue to invest were it makes sense and where the customers tell us they really value it and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. ","972":"So we tend to really focus on how we\u2019re managing the business to make sure that we\u2019re achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we\u2019re finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce our cost saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. ","973":"W. Rodney McMullen","974":"That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it is important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range. ","975":"And Alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of gift cards and the other related items. ","976":"Operator","977":"And that question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. And Mr. Cerankosky dropped his line. The next question will be from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","978":"Michael Montani","979":"Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the core gross margin for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments and the pharmacy, what are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend if you could. Thank you. ","980":"W. Rodney McMullen","981":"Yeah, if you look at on the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going, buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment, but as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things which funded quite a bit of investment as well. Gary, anything you want to add to that? ","982":"Gary Millerchip","983":"I think you said it well, Rodney. ","984":"W. Rodney McMullen","985":"One of our most powerful competitive advantage is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3% and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands such as Private Selection led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. ","986":"Okay.","987":"W. Rodney McMullen","988":"Before we end today\u2019s call, one of the things that\u2019s exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how all of us live our purpose every day. ","989":"As America\u2019s grocer, Kroger takes seriously our role in celebrating our uniquely American heritage during the patriotic season between Memorial Day and Independence Day. It always makes me feel incredibly proud that Kroger employs so many men and women who have served or currently serving the armed forces. ","990":"I got a chance to personally live our purpose last Saturday with our Veterans Associate Resource Group who put on 5K run to raise money for veterans. While I certainly didn\u2019t finish first, and nowhere close to last either, I would like to add in the race, I did have a different kind of first. Touring a specifically designed tiny house that our caring associates dreamed up and then built for a deserving local veteran and his family.","991":"The home was built to green technology standards, made from recycled materials, and features solar panels, demonstrating our associates\u2019 commitment to and passion for Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger\/Zero Waste social impact plan. In addition to the home, our Cincinnati Dayton division donated a Kroger gift card and a bag of Our Brands products to turn a new tiny house into a home, and it really felt great. ","992":"One of the many ways Kroger shows our gratitude and appreciation to all of our service members and their family is through our long-standing commitment to the USO. Kroger is the single largest donor to the USO, contributing over $22 million over the past decade. In keeping with this commitment, we will be presenting the USO with a $1 million donation at a barbecue for the troops event we are hosting at Fort Stewart in July. It is our honor and privilege as America\u2019s grocer to serve America\u2019s heroes. ","993":"Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. ","994":"Operator","995":"The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.","996":"We know that our customers love our brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brand items.","997":"Our customer's favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection Pork Belly Bites, Private Selection Artesian jerky, and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter. ","998":"W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & CEO","999":"Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. ","1000":"Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pick-up or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pick-up or delivery services, or Ship. ","1001":"Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omni-channel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I call this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made. ","1002":"2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado, and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers anything, anytime, anywhere.","1003":"Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado.","1004":"Kroger's partnership with Ocado will for the first time introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This in turn means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America. ","1005":"We are also making progress building out our Alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on Alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. ","1006":"Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic to improve the customer experience which then supports new margin-rich asset-light businesses. We expect Alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature Alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our media businesses, and customer data insights.","1007":"There other initiatives within our Alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in, and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where Alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks. ","1008":"One of the challenges of transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotal next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. ","1009":"Gary Millerchip - CFO","1010":"We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our New Business Development including partnerships and Kroger's Alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. ","1011":"Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed, and made in partnership with Kroger's board of directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new Senior Vice Presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward. ","1012":"Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social, and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger\/Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. ","1013":"As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phase-out of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. ","1014":"Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interests. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. ","1015":"Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. ","1016":"The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. ","1017":"As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments. ","1018":"Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who has been in the CFO role since April. Gary?","1019":"Gary Millerchip","1020":"Conference Call Participants","1021":"Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights, and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities, in-store, pick-up, delivery and Ship. ","1022":"As Rodney discussed, we had a few headwinds during the first quarter including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure, similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. ","1023":"I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan and Alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. ","1024":"On that note, last quarter we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our Alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect Alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements. ","1025":"Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification. ","1026":"Through the first quarter of 2019, Alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our media business and seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters. ","1027":"Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. ","1028":"We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. ","1029":"Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin excluding fuel decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. ","1030":"The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. ","1031":"Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","1032":"OG&A cost as a rate of sales excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. ","1033":"Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. ","1034":"Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. ","1035":"Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. ","1036":"Turning now to talent development, we are supporting associates in a variety of ways including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer.","1037":"The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most stocks and associates will receive regular wage increases every six months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. ","1038":"We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after six months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. ","1039":"In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. ","1040":"Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. ","1041":"Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. ","1042":"Judah Frommer - Credit Suisse","1043":"A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. ","1044":"We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt to EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YOU Technology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so. ","1045":"I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YOU Tech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. ","1046":"As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term services agreement with Inmar. YOU Tech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. ","1047":"Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include a liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. ","1048":"Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the gear. For 2019, identical sales growth excluding fuel, we continue to target identical sales that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share, and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. Rodney, back to you. ","1049":"W. Rodney McMullen","1050":"Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear-eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. ","1051":"Now we look forward to your questions. ","1052":"Question-and-Answer Session","1053":"Edward Kelly - Wells Fargo","1054":"Operator","1055":"We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","1056":"Robbie Ohmes","1057":"Oh, thanks. Good morning, guys. ","1058":"W. Rodney McMullen","1059":"Good morning. ","1060":"Robbie Ohmes","1061":"Rodney, my question is could you talk a little bit about, now that you're a quarter into this year, how your price investment plan is trending? Is it more or less than what you were expecting? And maybe remind us what kind of price investment year 2019 is expected to be. And maybe weave that into how that plays out into the expectation for accelerating IDs. ","1062":"And then also maybe weave in just the environment you're seeing out there competitively. We're seeing signs of the promotional environment in produce being a little more aggressive than it's been in a while. If you could weave the picture together for us, that would be great. ","1063":"W. Rodney McMullen","1064":"Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","1065":"Thanks, Robbie. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. ","1066":"If you look at the 2019 investment, it would be a reasonable amount. It would not be as much as what we did in 2018 because as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our 2019 investments into 2018 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. ","1067":"When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes, and overall we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more, but when you look at it all-in-all, it looks pretty consistent with before. ","1068":"On accelerating the identicals, it really is \u2013 one of the things on space optimization now is becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been \u2013 has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. ","1069":"Robbie Ohmes","1070":"Terrific. Thanks so much. ","1071":"W. Rodney McMullen","1072":"Thanks, Robbie. ","1073":"Operator","1074":"The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","1075":"Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:","1076":"Company Participants","1077":"Good afternoon and welcome to Netflix Q1 2019 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spencer Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","1078":"Okay. Spence, I wanted to jump off the M&A question and ask more about capital allocation. You're now more settled in your role than I think it was seven or eight days when we did this interview three months ago, so I'm going to grill you a little bit harder on what you're seeing in your role? What you see as some of the big opportunities for you to tackle in the role as CFO here at the company and how that fits into the broader capital allocation pecking order for the company is trying to accomplish?","1079":"Spencer Neumann","1080":"Yeah. I think it's very much aligned with what Reed just mentioned in terms of we just see this incredible growth profile for the business. If we remain focused and execute, it is this giant market that is continuing to shift from linear to on-demand and streaming, so there is a giant market opportunity globally and we want to execute against that, so that ties into your focus in terms of capital allocation and getting smarter and smarter about how we allocate our content dollars and programming mixes in partnering with Ted and the team and continuing to invest in the product and the experience with Greg and his team. So that's what we\u2019re most focused on and then helping to continue to scale our company. ","1081":"So we intend to be a much larger and much more profitable self-funding company over time, that is the path we're on as we talked about in the letter, we're committed to improve our cash flow profile meaningfully starting in 2020 and then each year thereafter, we'll continue our capital structure similar to how we funded it today to continue on that path, we've talked a lot about that in the past. So to me, it's really about helping the team continue to focus, remain disciplined and build that -- continue to build that muscle of increasing profitability and improving our cash flow profile as we scale.","1082":"Eric Sheridan","1083":"Maybe one more for you following up there, Spence, came in to me in a couple of different ways from a lot of debt investors asking about the expansion of the credit facility, the prior comment about free cash flow improving in '20 over '19, how should investors think about the self-funding component versus the need to continue to tap the debt capital markets as you think of funding the business initiatives inside the company?","1084":"Spencer Neumann","1085":"Yeah. Well, there's no real change in our philosophy or our strategy. So we did expand our revolver recently, we did that just because this business has gotten larger. It was an opportunity for us at the same cost of capital, so it's there for a rainy day, we don't -- we haven't used it, we don't intend to use it, but we thought it was prudent to take advantage of and we'll continue on our path of funding with a high yield market. As you know, we have a very significant cushion between our total equity capitalization and our debt-to-capital ratio. ","1086":"We also have a high level of interest in those -- in the debt funding markets. It is the most efficient cost of capital for us. We spend a lot of time -- I spend a lot of time, as a new CFO, focused on our liquidity, our payment timing and our cash flow needs and feel very comfortable with this approach to our capital structure. And then, as I said, this is -- it's not a forever in terms of using the debt markets to fund our cash flow needs, because we're moving towards that self-funding path, as I said, starting in 2020.","1087":"Reed Hastings","1088":"With that, let me turn it over to Eric for the first question. ","1089":"So I think the message, Eric, to debt investors is, you better debt in soon, because there's not going to be that much more to go.","1090":"Eric Sheridan","1091":"Truly noted. Maybe sticking with content, but I'd love to start with Reed and then go to Ted. Probably, the most important question I get a lot from investors is thinking through the narrative of some of the license content that's been popular on the platform coming off over the next couple of years due to some of the industry players making their own decisions and how you think about aligning your own investments around your own original content to fill in any gaps that happen from a consumption standpoint.","1092":"Maybe just starting with you Reed, how do you think about the content landscape and how it feeds into the competitive landscape? And, Ted, I would love to understand from you how that feeds into the planning for content, not only in '19, but over maybe the short or medium term over the next couple of years?","1093":"Reed Hastings","1094":"Well, we don't think about it as filling in, that's very minimalist. We think about it as can we change the world with great stories and we're so thrilled to be able to have the money to do that and to invest forward. And I think you'll see that the series and the movies and the reality that we're doing, the nature programming, I mean, you look at Our Planet, that's not filling in for anything else, that's setting a bold new vision of what programming can be. And so, we're charging forward. Again, we've expected this decline of second window content, been ready for it, anticipating it, in fact, we're eager to be able to have more and more of our money, be able to do spectacular new titles. ","1095":"So let me pass it over to you, Ted.","1096":"Ted Sarandos","1097":"Yes. I'm 100% concurred, and I think what's -- the thing to keep in mind is, this is seven years ago when we thought it was likely that the studios and networks would like to keep their second windows for themselves over time, then we better start getting good at creating our own programming and getting in business with creators who could do that for us and with us. And that's what we set out to do. ","1098":"And over every year, our percentage of spend, our percentage of hours watched have continued to grow toward our own -- owned original and branded shows on Netflix and films, and we're trying to do that across all the things that people love, scripted series, unscripted series, feature films, documentaries, standup comedy, great kids programming.","1099":"Question-and-Answer Session","1100":"As Reed said, it isn't just replacing one thing for another. We have this great You vs. Wild, which is an interactive show for kids. ","1101":"It's mostly being done with families that they can watch interactively together and we'll have about 25 million people spending a lot of time on You vs Wild in the first 28 days on Netflix, which is an incredible success and it's pushing storytelling forward, which I think we're trying -- we're going to be doing with things like the Irishman, both in terms of windows of availability and also in the kind of the technical execution of great storytelling and that's what we're really after. So there's a lot of focus on what's licensed and how much gets watched and all those things.","1102":"And so on the entire history of television, there are lots and lots of hours of programming that people watch fairly interchangeably, but the shows that we -- that our members most value us for and the things that we really pay a lot of attention to, if you look at our top 10 most watched shows on Netflix, they're all Netflix Original brands; and the top 25, there's only four shows that have at least a single season that crack into top 25 even. So increasingly, our business is about creating and telling great stories around the world that are exclusively on Netflix and giving opportunity for new storytellers all over the world.","1103":"Spencer Wang","1104":"Eric, I would just add, if you look at the multi-year sort of track record of the company, we've gone through different periods of the content library changing where there were Epics or stores in general we've been able to sort of adjust the content library and really grow right through that.","1105":"Ted Sarandos","1106":"Yeah. It's hard to imagine, it was 2017, a couple of years ago when Fox said -- Sunset all of their second window content on Netflix off of the service to focus on their own efforts and we've seen how we've been doing since 2017, so we're pretty happy about it. ","1107":"Spencer Wang","1108":"And then before that, there was Epics coming off in discovery and we just continued to grow throughout that by using the money to invest like Our Planet, we commissioned four years ago. So there's a lot of planning that goes into this and that's what makes it exciting.","1109":"Eric Sheridan","1110":"Q - Eric Sheridan","1111":"Well, along those lines, I thought there was a really interesting piece in the shareholder letter that looked at a product that would show users the top 10 shows that were trending. It seems like it's a beta test in the UK. Greg, would love to understand what the goal of that beta test is, what it might do for user engagement, how you think about that as a sort of natural evolution of the product to almost create crowdsourced content engagement?","1112":"Greg Peters","1113":"Yeah. It's an example of one of 100 tests that we'll do in a given quarter to try and actually make the product experience better, but the core idea behind this is there's a bunch of our members who really enjoy watching the most popular shows, because they enjoy watching the show and then engaging in the public conversation around the show and all the memes that are shared around. And so the idea here is, let's look at job at using the product and other public communication channels to basically let our members know what are those most popular shows so they can watch and then participate in that public conversation. And so, we're quite bullish on that and we'll see how it does.","1114":"Ted Sarandos","1115":"And I would only add that it's a popularity as a data point that people can use to choose, not the most important one and not the only one, but we don't want to suppress it if it's helpful to our members.","1116":"Greg Peters","1117":"That's exactly right. And I think, to Ted's point basically, our members have a broad set of things that they're evaluating, what they want to watch and our job is to figure out, for any given member, what's the information that they're going to find most relevant to make that decision. For some members, that'll be popular.","1118":"Eric Sheridan","1119":"Greg, sticking with you, another point that was raised again in the letter was around distribution deals. What they're doing for the business is both growing the brand, growing awareness of the service driving subscriber growth, can you give us a little granularity on sort of what you see from these partnerships? What it means for the company longer term? And what the landscape even could look like to do additional partnerships over time?","1120":"Greg Peters","1121":"Thank you, Spencer. Reed, I'd love to start with you. Now that we're three months into 2019, against your broader goals for what you're expecting for the business in 2019, what are the key messages you want to share with investors on how the first three months of the year went?","1122":"Yeah. Again, this is sort of something we've been on a 10 plus year trajectory on in improving the way that we use partners or the way that we leverage those other companies out there to make a connection with members and start with just putting our application on different devices. So, yeah, there was another easy way to find Netflix and to enjoy the service and go from there, but progressively, we found things like bill on behalf of where members could pay for Netflix via their mobile operator charge or their pay TV charge, that was yet another way to make it easier to sign up.","1123":"And then most recently, we have bundle deals, where it\u2019s sort of the simplest model where you just get Netflix as part of your pay TV offering or your mobile offering. That's a great way for folks to try Netflix very simply, they have easy access to viewing on maybe their set-top box or their mobile phone and allows us to access a subscriber base that might be a little bit slower in signing up directly with us for Netflix. ","1124":"But I think it's also -- and while these bundled deals are great, they're performing quite well for us and we want to expand them. It's also, I think, relevant to note that, as a fraction through all those channels of the total sign ups we do in any given quarter, in any given year, it's still quite small relative to our organic channel or people signing up with us directly. So we'll see more and more of those and I think it's a nice supplemental channel that accelerates our growth with that.","1125":"Eric Sheridan","1126":"Ted, maybe turning to you on the movies front. Obviously, you continue to evolve the strategy on distribution of movies when you think about some of the things having to go into theaters or thinking about different windows yourself for new movie content, how has that strategy evolved? What sort of feedback are you getting from the content creation community? What are you seeing from users and how they want to consume the content? And how might that sort of continue to evolve the movies' strategy over the medium to long term?","1127":"Ted Sarandos","1128":"Well, I think these are all case-by-case. So in a lot of times, I would say that we always have been for consumer choice. If I had my way, I would love to have the movies that are in Netflix to be available in 2,000 theaters at the same time that they're on Netflix. We just don't control the programming of those theaters. So when I say that, what I mean is, if people want to go out and have a good time and pick a great movie and if we're making the great movie, if they don't have the opportunity to see it on a screen, they just -- they don't go out. So the opportunity I think would be to give consumers as much choice as possible, but we can only control what's on Netflix.","1129":"And we are the -- primarily we're releasing in theaters and on Netflix day and date, meaning that by the time they've been there on Netflix at the same time they're in the theaters, we have an opportunity -- we're taking the opportunity to promote the films and generate publicity for the films, release them in select theaters a few weeks early, but in general we want it to be in theaters and on Netflix at the same time, but we can only control Netflix. And I think what it is a lot less to do with the room in which people can consume and all those other things as we have to focus on making great movies. And then anyone who's involved in the ecosystem of presenting movies and watching movies, we'll have to take notice of those films. So that's what we're trying to do, is just make undeniably great movies with undeniably great filmmakers.","1130":"Spencer Wang","1131":"Eric, we have time for one more question, please.","1132":"Reed Hastings","1133":"Eric Sheridan","1134":"Sure. So, Reed, I'd love to end with you with a little bit of a lighthearted question, but also one that I think allows you to frame a little bit about where you've come from and where you've gone. I noticed in the press at the last week, our competitor said that Netflix may or may not have a brand, it's what they implied. And I figure you probably disagree with the statement that Netflix doesn't have a brand. So I would love to understand your vision of sort of where the Netflix brand has come over the last half decade as you've evolved the company and how do you think about repositioning and evolving the brand to stay at the front of the curve of where the industry's going over the next half decade?","1135":"Reed Hastings","1136":"We're a mix of great innovator that people love us for trying new things. That's both in terms of on-demand and it's creatively with a different series that we're doing and being really great comfort food where you just want to curl up and enjoy and you know Netflix is going to be great. So, it's that combination of comfort and innovation that's so powerful for us. ","1137":"And when I think of the quarter, just to wrap up, the one little time I was not watching Netflix on Sunday, I was watching Tiger Woods and the PGA, and like probably half of the America, and when I think of those beautiful shots right down the middle of the fairway, I think about the 6,000 employees at Netflix hitting that perfect clean shot and that's what the quarter was.","1138":"Reed Hastings","1139":"So congratulations to everyone on a fantastic Q1 and looking forward to getting the green jacket for the year for this team.","1140":"Well, we put in the earnings letter, our weekly net adds and it's just phenomenal how steady and smooth and up into the right that is to start off the year with over 9.5 million net additions, it's a phenomenal start. So steady progress, basically the same as many prior quarters cranking away on amazing content, amazing service and steady growth around the world.","1141":"Eric Sheridan","1142":"Maybe sticking with that theme on the subscriber front, we'd love to understand some of what you saw internationally in subscriber strength. There were some particular pieces of content that seemed to resonate globally on an individual and on a worldwide basis, so I'd love to ask both from a content perspective and a subscriber growth perspective, maybe to Ted and Greg, how are you thinking about the subscriber performance, especially internationally in Q1?","1143":"Ted Sarandos","1144":"Spencer Wang - IR","1145":"Well, the one thing that was good about in terms of the content connection is the things that worked best that we called on the letter are things that worked around the world, which was really fantastic. And then we had some great international breakouts where they really helped drive excitement in, by the way of example, a Kingdom in Korea that did phenomenal and get watched and it's getting watched all over the world and throughout the region. So, yeah, we think we've been able to work on a very local basis and very global basis with the content this year, this quarter.","1146":"Greg Peters","1147":"And then from the product perspective, yeah, the basic model that we've seen consistently across pretty much all the markets that we operate in is, as we launch our service, we get a chance to learn from our members, they tell us what content we incrementally need to provide to them, we do better job at that, how we modify the product experience, what we need to add from a payments perspective, from a partners perspective, and we're seeing that basically in all the markets that we operate in the world. And so, the longer we've been in that territory like Europe, it's a great example, we've got a lot of stuff dialed in and consumers are really loving us and that's leading to a great accelerating growth.","1148":"Eric Sheridan","1149":"Ted, maybe following up with you on local content that goes global, you've got a number of hits now that started as local language and went global, are you getting better at identifying what those pieces of content might be. What are your learnings as you're getting more of those types of successes in the model?","1150":"Ted Sarandos","1151":"Well, we've kept one strict principle around it, which was that these shows have to be very locally relevant and to do that, you have to be pretty authentically local. So, what we're trying not to do is try to in-authentically make a global show, because basically that doesn't work for anybody. So the more authentically local the show is, the better it travels, which we've seen with Kingdom, so fans of K-Drama around the world loved that show and it resonated incredibly well for us in Korea. Similarly, coming up, we have a new season of The Rain coming out this quarter, that is perfectly Swedish. We don't try to make it -- water it down or make it travel any better inorganically and it found that the best way to make global stories is to make them incredibly authentically local.","1152":"Eric Sheridan","1153":"So, Greg, maybe coming back to you on the subscriber front, you had some information in the letter about the amount of traffic globally that you get from mobile, but we're continuing to see performance above what we thought in terms of download of Netflix app on phones globally. Can you talk a little bit about mobile as a stimulant for both traffic, subscriber growth, and how you might go after that on the product side over the medium and long term?","1154":"Greg Peters","1155":"Reed Hastings - CEO","1156":"Sure. I think the most important, the headline message there is actually frankly how much time we don't win on the mobile experience, right. So over -- in 97.5% around the world, people are using other different entertainment services, other ways to enjoy their time on their mobile phone. But certainly what we are seeing is that mobile is an increasing way for us to attract new subscribers. It's a great place for folks to find out about Netflix, to sign up for the service, even if they're signing up for the service on mobile and then they're watching on other devices like the TV, which we see as a common paradigm. ","1157":"It works really well with our partners, because whether it's handset partners, which we can work to sort of preload our application on or actually the mobile operators which we can work on increasingly doing things like bundling the Netflix as part of their standard offering, which you see us doing more and more around the world. It's a great way for us to make it super simple for our members to sign up for Netflix and enjoy that experience.","1158":"Eric Sheridan","1159":"Maybe I'll start with Spencer, but would love a couple of different perspectives on this. It was a solid outperformance on margin in the quarter and the company talked about shifting some expenses into the later part of the year than maybe what you'd envisioned when you had guided Q1. Can you talk a little bit about how the cost structure evolved in the business in Q1, how that margin outperformance came about and maybe give a little bit more granularity on those shift in costs as you look through the better part of 2019?","1160":"Spencer Neumann","1161":"Yes, sure. I think that the takeaway is, we're overall very pleased with our continued margin progression. We guided at the beginning of the year to increasing our margins by 300 basis points for the full year to 13%. We came in this quarter slightly ahead. Part of this, we're continuing to scale our business in terms of some combination of content and marketing spend, in particular, growing at a slower rate than revenue in this quarter, in particular I think you saw that on the marketing line where we had a lot of both growth and experimentation in marketing last year, which we talked about.","1162":"We talked about the fact that we would level off that growth this year and you saw that come into play in Q1, which was a meaningful driver of that margin expansion. The timing in the quarter was not all that significant. There were some spend, particularly on timing of some creative spend and creative development spend on the marketing side in particular that shifted to later in the year as well as some content spend, but nothing material and we are well on track to that 13% full year margin.","1163":"Eric Sheridan","1164":"And just to follow up there, Spence, just to make sure we understand the message from the letter. Still second half versus first half should be the way investors think about the margin profile of the business this year against that broader 13% goal?","1165":"Spencer Neumann","1166":"Spencer Neumann - CFO","1167":"Yes, Sheridan, I mean, you'll see some margin expansion as you can see in the guide for Q2 as well and then it will continue to expand in the back half of the year. As you know, there have been some price adjustments in the first half of the year that have been flowing through, so that also between that and just our member growth, we'll see the benefit of that margin expansion in the back half.","1168":"Eric Sheridan","1169":"Maybe one more on the quarter in the letter itself, back to you, Ted, for second quarter in a row, you gave a lot of information about consumption of the product in the quarter and some of the watch statistics. So I\u2019d love both Ted and Reed maybe to weigh in on how you think about the type of watch and engagement statistics the company is getting when measured against the broader media landscape, what that means for the company longer term and whether we can expect to continue to hear that from the company going forward?","1170":"Ted Sarandos ","1171":"Yeah, definitely. We're trying to get to a place where we could be a lot more transparent, both with our producers and with our customers who are incredibly interested in helping them make better choices by based on -- and so a lot of times, that's influenced heavily by what's the world watching. So being able to share some of those numbers gives people a better sense of what things that they might be interested in as well. ","1172":"And just real quickly, [indiscernible] but obviously this show is from Denmark. But I wanted to point out that over the next several months, we're going to be rolling out more specific granular reporting first to our producers and then to our members and of course to the press over time and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on Netflix around the world.","1173":"Eric Sheridan","1174":"And Reed, how do you think about the broader media landscape? What Netflix is trying to sell for and go after as a big opportunity over time when measured against the type of watch or engagement just statistics that company is putting up against their original content?","1175":"Reed Hastings","1176":"I think we're just beginning to start to share that data, as Ted mentioned, and we'll be leaning into that more quarter-by-quarter. But the big picture for our members is, they watch all kinds of things. I mean, our members are watching pay-per-view and DVDs, our members are watching linear, our members are watching Fortnite or playing Fortnite, it's all of these things. So think of it as -- the real metric is, can we keep our members happy and grow that subscriber base as we did so strongly in Q1.","1177":"Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","1178":"Eric Sheridan","1179":"So maybe sticking with you, Reed, you had a section in the letter about Disney, some of the competition that's coming into the broader landscape, maybe just help people frame how you see the competitive landscape? How do you see those types of products existing alongside or in competition to Netflix? And what your sort of view is of the landscape going forward?","1180":"Reed Hastings","1181":"Sure. Well, one part is great competition makes you better. And so, we're thrilled to have Apple and Disney in, they are awesome companies and just to be in the same league as them is very exciting for us. And then on a practical basis, there's already so much competition. I mean, we mentioned we only win 2% of downloading on mobile, it's like 98% of the time people are not doing Netflix on US televisions, it's 90% are not watching Netflix, so there's a ton of competition out there and Disney and Apple add a little bit more, but frankly I doubt it will be material, because again there's already so many competitors for entertainment time, which is great for consumers and it's exciting for us.","1182":"Eric Sheridan","1183":"Greg, I'd love to take that answer and maybe go to you next of how you think about the product itself when you see potential new competitors coming to the field, what do you think some of the big differentiators you have on the product side, how do you think about pricing as a company longer term and maybe where you want to take the product medium to long term?","1184":"Greg Peters","1185":"Sure. I mean, again back to Reed's model, we sort of see this broad landscape of competition and our job is to think about every touchpoint that we have with the service and how can we make it incrementally more compelling, how do we connect our members with the amazing content that we're making in a way which is new and differentiating, you talked about international, that's a great opportunity where we think about localizing this content well, whether it's in subtitles or dubbing and then actually explaining to our members, connecting our members with those stories in a meaningful way, which then opens up them to watch TV shows or movies from around the world, from countries that they never would have conceived of doing before and I think that's a huge example of the opportunity we have to bring this global platform to bear and the right kind of product experience to create differentiation.","1186":"And then with regard to pricing, I would say, again back to this sort of framework of broad, broad competition where a bunch of different entertainment options are being provided all sorts of different models, some ad-based, subscription at different pricing points, we don't really think there is sort of an immediate equivalency or substitution. And so mostly it's about how do we create more value, how do we put the right content and present it in the right way that's compelling and differentiating for our members. If we think we do a great job at that, we'll just win more of those viewing hours, we'll deliver more value to our members and we'll be able to grow from a subscriber perspective like we did this quarter.","1187":"Eric Sheridan","1188":"Greg Peters - Chief Product Officer","1189":"Maybe turning to Q2, where you laid out -- the company laid out its vision for subscriber growth and talked a little bit about ARPU in Q2 as well, maybe talk a little bit broadly, I don't know, maybe Spence and then going to Greg as well, talk about the building blocks of the way in which you're framing the subscriber growth going forward in Q2, the price increases that are going through in a number of jurisdictions, what that means for ARPU, what it means for churn, so investors can better understand that.","1190":"Spencer Neumann","1191":"Yeah, sure. I can start and then others can chime in. You can see that we got it to 5 million of paid net adds in Q2, which is similar to where we were a year ago. There's definitely some seasonality to our business, which we see in Q2, you see that again this year, but I'd say in general, our paid net adds are very much in line with what we've been planning and targeting for the year. On a first half of the year basis, you see that's 7% year-over-year growth.","1192":"The specific growth in Q2 is more concentrated internationally, that's just as we talked about last quarter, we're rolling through our price changes in the US. So that has some moderation on our net adds and the good news there is that our -- the growth in our acquisition, it's consistent in terms of our ability to kind of grow our subscribers, there's just some temporary churn that enters the system in the midst of rolling out those price changes, but that\u2019s why you see more of the net adds weighted to our international segments in Q2. ","1193":"But overall very healthy going according to plan and very strong growth for the first half of the year and putting us on track as we also mentioned in the letter for another year of record paid net add growth for the full year.","1194":"Greg Peters","1195":"And, Eric, just to add on to what Spence said, in the guidance, you will see that there is an acceleration in ASP growth as well as in revenue growth in Q2 relative to Q1 and that's a function of some of those price adjustments that we talked about earlier.","1196":"Eric Sheridan","1197":"One maybe follow up, because it did come in, in advance in a number of [indiscernible], when you think about churn with the price increase, do you look to historical trends or do you look to sort of near term trends, because this was an interesting price increase that it started rolling into effect in the middle of Q1 and it appears it'll be done in terms of going into effect towards the middle to back-end of Q2. What are the historical trends you've been looked to anchor yourself to or you sort of looking at other recent price increases on markets like Canada and others to inform how to guide?","1198":"Spencer Neumann","1199":"Conference Call Participants","1200":"You want me to take that or --","1201":"Greg Peters","1202":"I would just say, maybe, there's a bunch of historical performance and modeling that we use to keep an eye on these things, but generally, I would say things are going as expected and this is one of those relatively infrequent moments where as we invest more in to service, more great content, we've got incredible movies coming like Irishman and 6 Underground, improving the product experience. We occasionally go back to our subscribers and ask them to contribute a little bit more, so that we can fund that next cycle of growth and everything that we're seeing right now is very consistent with that model.","1203":"Spencer Neumann","1204":"I would just add on to Greg too that as you know, even in the US, we -- for the first time, we increased our entry level pricing and the overall blended price increase was a bit, as a result, a little bit more significant than last time around and even with that, the churn levels are very consistent with -- when we last took pricing in the US. So it's all consistent with our plan and consistent with always what we've seen historically.","1205":"Eric Sheridan","1206":"Along those lines with pricing being driven by success on the content front, Ted, maybe you could talk a little bit, it's a very full content schedule as you get through Q2 and then the back part of the year, maybe frame a little bit about what you're excited to bring to members on Netflix? How so -- how that's lining up against some of the key investments you're making in some of the buckets like movies, local language content and some of the returning series that people know well on the platform?","1207":"Ted Sarandos","1208":"Yeah. Well, definitely in the third quarter, we've got new episodes and new seasons of some of our most loved and most watched shows on Netflix, Stranger Things, Casa de Papel, Orange Is the New Black, 13 Reasons Why, Elite, which was a big hit for us right out of Spain, a new season from Ryan Murphy of The Politician, a brand new show on Netflix that we think our audiences are going to love. ","1209":"And then you start seeing later in the fourth quarter some of our bigger film investments coming through like Irishman, like 6 Underground and also a big new original series that we're currently shooting in Hungary called The Witcher, that is enormous European IP, very popular game and Book IP, that we think is going to make a really fun global series. ","1210":"Eric Sheridan - UBS","1211":"So we've got -- and then moving into our kids and family and our animated originals both on the feature side and on the series side, two of our bigger bets, Klaus will be on our fourth quarter animated features and Green Eggs and Ham from Ellen DeGeneres exec producing very ambitious 13 episode animated original series with the feature quality animation that's been in the work for about four years, we're really excited to bring to our members in the fourth quarter.","1212":"Eric Sheridan","1213":"Looking out to Q2 and the rest of the year, would love to ask a little bit about what you're seeing in India? I know you don't break out subscriber additions, but we'd love to understand some of the investments you made in content in India? How those investments in content are resonating in the marketplace? And then maybe Greg you can pick it up and talk a little bit about the product side and what you're seeing from an adoption standpoint in India as well?","1214":"Ted Sarandos","1215":"Well, we've been \u2013 we were super encouraged out of the gate with Love Per Square Foot and Sacred Games, where not only do we get a lot of viewing in India but it just took an incredible position in the zeitgeist where people were talking about and writing about the excitement of a show of the quality of Sacred Games. And then recently we followed it up again with Delhi Crime that people are also really loving it in India and is getting watched outside of India as well. ","1216":"And most importantly, the steady drumbeat and then add to that another dozen original films coming in India that we're seeing the investment in local language content in India payback in the form of excitement and member growth and hours growth that's encouraging us to keep going.","1217":"Greg Peters","1218":"And as we sort of have that ongoing content investment and we're really providing stories that Indian consumers really love, it's an opportunity for us to look at how we broaden the accessibility of the service then to more and more Indian consumers. And so part of that is making sure that we have the right payments models in place and innovating and testing about our new models to make the Indian consumer feel like they have existing ways of paying that are natural to them that they can use to pay for Netflix.","1219":"It's also much in partnership stuff. We launched a big partnership with Airtel, which is working for us quite well, so we can use different go-to-market mechanisms already exist that any consumers aren't familiar with to make it easy for them to just sign up for the service and try it out. ","1220":"And frankly, we're also trying to do a bunch of experimentation with just our plan structure and thinking about pricing and plans and what do we do to test different models that allow us to bring a lower price plan with the right feature set at the right price in a way that any consumer and frankly consumers around the world can understand so we can broaden accessibility to service now. So all of that's an ongoing effort that we think is a great match for the broadening of the Indian content catalog that we have.","1221":"Spencer Wang","1222":"Eric Sheridan","1223":"Well, maybe if I could just follow up on one with that, Greg, it does seem like a mobile-only, maybe lower priced product could open up a lot of demand in the developing world, how do you think about some of the opportunities and the challenges when you think about a mobile-only offering or something at a lower price point and trying to get the mix of content versus subscriber economics right?","1224":"Greg Peters","1225":"Yeah. I think that's a great example of something that we're trying out, we're not positive that's the right model, but it's -- we're quite certain that we should do something to find a price tier that's lower than the existing lowest price tier to broaden that accessibility. We think that they'll be important to adding members in India. ","1226":"We'll see what the right mix of features is, because there is a bit of a magic to try and get the right set of features at the right price point in a way that the consumer can relate to, right, it has to be sort of natural and intuitive to the consumer that this is what they're getting. So we've got more work to go do there, but it's something we're highly focused on and anticipate, we'll make more progress in [indiscernible].","1227":"Eric Sheridan","1228":"Maybe, turning next to M&A and the broader strategy for the company, Reed, I'd love to start with you. As you look at the strategy you've laid out for the company over the medium to long term, how do you think about some of the aspects of the strategy that might be better to go out and acquire versus build yourself against the big long term opportunity? And maybe I'll follow up with one for Spence.","1229":"Reed Hastings","1230":"I don't think investors have too much to worry about there. We've been going for 20 years, we've done one or two micro acquisitions but no big appetite, no big need. We got clear sailing ahead. If we can produce the world's best content, we can deliver it with the best user interface, then we can grow for many, many years ahead. So that's what we're focused on. It's a lot of tough execution, it's keeping ourselves all focused on that and then we're letting other companies do many different strategies, but we know what ours is and we're having a lot of fun just executing on it.","1231":"Eric Sheridan","0":"Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:","1":"Company Participants","10":"Pierre Ferragu - New Street Research","100":"Well, first of all, obviously on account of tents, like I mean, we like hardcore tents, so I am not like Cub Scout tents, which are fine, but this is actually \u2013 credit goes to Tesla team, because they actually look at how could we do this in Fremont if we had to and we feel like we can actually append building space to the \u2013 to the west side of the building and use a lot of internal space that\u2019s currently used for warehousing in the Fremont factory. And so we believe it actually can be done with minimal disruption to add Model Y to Fremont.","101":"Ryan Brinkman","102":"Thank you.","103":"Operator","104":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.","105":"Pierre Ferragu","106":"Hey, thanks for the call. My first question is really on the Model S and Model X and Elon, you said you are comfortable with the one you see \u2013 based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter is the level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already or are we not there yet? And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 probably hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Is that something that we still see the numbers today in recent weeks or is that behind us? And I have a follow-up on Q2.","107":"Elon Musk","108":"Yes. I mean, I think something like \u2013 returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for S and X is what we anticipate. That\u2019s to the best to my knowledge. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but that\u2019s probably our best guess. And sorry, what was the other point?","109":"Pierre Ferragu","11":"Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","110":"Yes. My question was about like the run-rate of demand you see at the moment, do you still feel like weak demand in the U.S. because of the pull forward in Q4 or do you think demand returned to normal already?","111":"Elon Musk","112":"I think we expect demand to \u2013 we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2. And it might be a little better than normal. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, it\u2019s hard for me to say, but my impression right now is that demand is quite solid, quite strong, yes.","113":"Pierre Ferragu","114":"And then my second question was briefly on...","115":"Elon Musk","116":"Sorry, Zach would like to...","117":"Zachary Kirkhorn","118":"Yes. Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X. We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted. That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2. So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3. It\u2019s already increasing.","119":"Pierre Ferragu","12":"Maynard Um - Macquarie","120":"And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am surprised you don\u2019t \u2013 you just still expect a loss. So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a profit for similar volumes? How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and other things?","121":"Elon Musk","122":"Sure. So quite a bit, but we think if we didn\u2019t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America. And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it\u2019s West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars. But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just \u2013 not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive efforts from Tesla team. So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave. And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?","123":"Zachary Kirkhorn","124":"Yes. No, I think you summarized it well, Elon. Two other things that I would add. One is we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margin. And so that\u2019s part of what we will see in Q2. The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost efficiency of the business without sacrificing growth and that in combination with the efficiencies from unwinding the wave, is where we feel we will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of those pieces are in place.","125":"Pierre Ferragu","126":"Thank you.","127":"Martin Viecha","128":"Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","129":"Operator","13":"Dan Galves - Wolfe Research","130":"Our next question is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","131":"Adam Jonas","132":"Thanks. First question, Elon, a couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is the Autopilot technology and you said something like twice as safe as normal driving, but you seem to be in a really unique position to really collect exobytes of data, you could potentially be externally validated much more rigorously provided the regulatory body or insurance institute to just show how much safer Autopilot is. When could we expect to see Tesla do that, that type of validation that investors could also get a sense of? It seems really, really important for adoption. Thanks. And I have a follow up.","133":"Elon Musk","134":"I think we are just going to continue to report the absolute numbers. I think a point of detail just give those of you our bytes of Tesla that maybe sort of like data mine the situation and then try to turn it positive into negative. So we are just going to keep reporting report. We do give some more detailed information to insurance companies to help with rates. And obviously as we launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that information into the insurance rates. So, we essentially have a substantial price and sort of arbitrage or information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and based on the car and then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they would have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher. So we are just going to keep reporting the numbers at a broad stroke level, which I think is really what matters.","135":"Adam Jonas","136":"Okay, I understand it.","137":"Elon Musk","138":"That\u2019s the safety.","139":"Adam Jonas","14":"Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","140":"Okay. And just as a follow-up, Elon and you kind of alluded a little bit, there is just so much drama around Tesla\u2019s share price and quarterly results. From the outside at least, it looks like a huge distraction. And at the same time, there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital that is incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership. So how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?","141":"Elon Musk","142":"Well, mate, I don\u2019t want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private, but unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed, so...","143":"Adam Jonas","144":"But is it important? I mean, you think the company\u2019s value is maximized being public? Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play the hand you\u2019re dealt?","145":"Elon Musk","146":"Well, I think this feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way. And I think Warren Buffett\u2019s analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your house every day. It\u2019s still the same house.","147":"Adam Jonas","148":"Yes.","149":"Elon Musk","15":"Alex Potter - Piper Jaffray","150":"So, it\u2019s a bit of a distraction at times, but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it.","151":"Adam Jonas","152":"Okay understood. Thanks.","153":"Operator","154":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.","155":"Maynard Um","156":"Hi thanks. In the update letter, you talked about supplier limitations impacting production. Can you just talk about what that was and how long you think that might continue to impact you? And then I have a follow up.","157":"Elon Musk","158":"In Q2, we don\u2019t we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the significant ones that we\u2019re aware of.","159":"Maynard Um","16":"Philippe Houchois - Jefferies","160":"Okay. And I guess there was some concern out there that Model 3 was cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different vehicle classes, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence that proves, disproves this? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","161":"Elon Musk","162":"No, they\u2019re reducing through different market segments. Yes.","163":"Zachary Kirkhorn","164":"And also, not only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S. So, it\u2019s from all the Model 3 trade-ins, Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.","165":"Elon Musk","166":"Yes, for sure. People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.","167":"Martin Viecha","168":"Okay let\u2019s go to the next question please.","169":"Operator","17":"David Tambourino - Goldman Sachs","170":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.","171":"Dan Galves","172":"Hi thanks everybody. A couple of questions. One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments? Is that what you\u2019re, kind of seeing as order flow? I\u2019m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?","173":"Zachary Kirkhorn","174":"Yes, this is Zach. I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that there\u2019s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced. And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it\u2019s starting the average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes. And just under $50,000 ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it\u2019s starting to stabilize there. And we\u2019ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we\u2019re seeing in North America is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].","175":"Dan Galves","176":"That\u2019s really helpful. And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way. So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades. But on Model 3, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is for Model 3, does your current order flow support that? Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?","177":"Elon Musk","178":"I think we\u2019ll I think we\u2019ll be fine. Yes, I don\u2019t think there any major thing required.","179":"Dan Galves","18":"Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer","180":"Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","181":"Operator","182":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.","183":"Toni Sacconaghi","184":"Yes, thank you. Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren\u2019t you potentially trying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic. So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn\u2019t do? Or wouldn\u2019t do? And I have a follow up, please.","185":"Elon Musk","186":"Yes. I don\u2019t think raising capital should be substitute for making the company operate more effectively. So that in that sense, I think it\u2019s just, it\u2019s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to make sure we don\u2019t have extraneous expenses and we\u2019re just being frugal with capital. If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional operation of the business. So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while. At this point, I do think there are it is similar to raising capital. That\u2019s a but this is sort of probably about the right timing, but yes.","187":"Toni Sacconaghi","188":"So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term? And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean growth does eat cash especially in a capital-intensive business. If you really do believe you have a first mover advantage, why wouldn\u2019t you want to push it as quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short term.","189":"Elon Musk","19":"Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","190":"Yes. First of all, I\u2019ll just say that I don\u2019t think capital has been constrained on our growth thus far and the type of those fund in fact, if there was a final constraint on growth would\u2019ve faced capital before now. But I think it is very important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we\u2019re we have the appropriate financial discipline throughout the company and are spending money very efficiently. At this point, I think we are doing that. There\u2019s more work to do, and Tesla today is far more efficient operating organization than it was a year ago. We\u2019ve made dramatic improvements across the board. And so, I think there\u2019s merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.","191":"Zachary Kirkhorn","192":"Just to add to that, the journey we\u2019ve been on for the last 12 to 18 months on being more efficient and how we spend money has really changed the full trends of the company. It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements in operating expenses as well. And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here. So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.","193":"Elon Musk","194":"And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $500 million. So that we want to make sure that we don\u2019t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.","195":"Martin Viecha","196":"Thank you. Now let\u2019s go to the next question please.","197":"Operator","198":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.","199":"Alex Potter","2":"Martin Viecha - Senior Director, Investor Relations","20":"Colin Langan - UBS","200":"Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter. You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward. Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you\u2019re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...","201":"Elon Musk","202":"No, they would actually receive their cars sooner. It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter. And that this [indiscernible] we don\u2019t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time. We literally delivered half of the entire quarter\u2019s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1. That\u2019s insane. So, I think we need to unwind that. I suppose it\u2019s not a great customer experience because we\u2019re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars. And then we then they can do their regular jobs. So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.","203":"Alex Potter","204":"Okay. That makes sense. Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was focused on closing storefronts. A fair amount of noise made around that. And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy. I was just wondering if there\u2019s any update there. If you have that, that would be helpful. Thanks.","205":"Elon Musk","206":"Sure. I think Tesla just sort of I didn\u2019t handle messaging of that well. I mean, that\u2019s amplified by statement taking to an extreme where there was a misunderstanding. We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided they are in locations where there is high foot traffic and that are in our target market. So, we actually will continue to add stores in locations are no-brainers. We will close stores in locations where they are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very low such that it does not support the cost of the store and the people in it. So, I think it\u2019s just common sense. And then all sales online just, means that even if you go into a store, you we would guide you to order the car on your phone. So, source essentially like there like information centers, place you can get a test drive and buy some Tesla merchandise, that kind of thing. But all sales online, doesn\u2019t mean all stores are closed. Just means when you buy a car, you always do it on your phone in the store or at home or anywhere. Orders online doesn\u2019t, meant all stores are closing. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s meant.","207":"Alex Potter","208":"Okay very good. Thanks.","209":"Operator","21":"Operator","210":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.","211":"Philippe Houchois","212":"Hi yes, thank you for taking the questions. I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on the agreement you seem to have reached with FCA on the possibility of selling your CO2 credits to them in Europe and what that means to your potential cash inflow. When that might start occurring? And if there is any chance any of those things are in your Q1 cash position?","213":"Elon Musk","214":"I think it\u2019s a confidential deal with FCA so we and we agreed with FCA not to comment on it publicly so we must abide by that.","215":"Philippe Houchois","216":"And can I ask you a question of coming back to what Adam was saying about the drama that surrounds your unfortunately, why don\u2019t you reduce some of it by disclosing on a monthly basis your deliveries and also maybe disclosing early your greenhouse revenue instead of just reserves so we get right away a better view on some of these details that kind of move the stock.","217":"Elon Musk","218":"I think that would actually be counterproductive because people read too much into what occurred in a month. I mean, even at a quarterly basis, things can be lumpy. And so the more granularity that\u2019s provided on a monthly level, the few would reach all sorts of conclusions that doesn\u2019t makes sense. It\u2019s like literally sales to a particular country, say, overseas are affected by when the ship arrives. And so, if the ship arrives on the 31st of the month or the first of the next month, this will make it look like something dramatic has happened. But actually, the ship was just a day late. So, people read that would increase the drama, not decrease it.","219":"Zachary Kirkhorn","22":"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Tesla Q1 2019 Financial Results and Q&A webcast. My name is Sherry and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may now proceed.","220":"And we\u2019re filling the ship 100% [indiscernible].","221":"Elon Musk","222":"Filling the ship 100% so it\u2019s like it just ends up being lumpy. So, like if you managed if you\u2019ve calculated like GDP of a country to offset the U.S., GDP on Sunday is extremely low, but GDP on a Monday is extremely high. It does not mean nothing has really changed.","223":"Operator","224":"Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tambourino with Goldman Sachs.","225":"David Tambourino","226":"Great. Thanks for taking our questions. First one, on customer deposits, it looks like it\u2019s essentially flat to maybe slightly down. I understand it\u2019s probably some timing with deliveries that could have helped it towards the end of the quarter. But we would have thought it would have increased given the Model Y [indiscernible]. So, our question is what was the initial order intake for the Model Y? And just coming through combing some of your comment earlier, what daily order rate are you seeing right now for the rest of your products?","227":"Elon Musk","228":"I think we don\u2019t want to comment on the granularity of deposits. Again, people read too much into this. We\u2019re not playing of the Model Y because we\u2019re just not in production so you can\u2019t really read anything into Model Y orders at this point.","229":"David Tambourino","23":"Martin Viecha","230":"Okay. Well, then my second question would just be if you anticipate a further price adjustment the next level view credit phasing out July 1?","231":"Elon Musk","232":"We don\u2019t comment on future price changes unless you see it publicly.","233":"Martin Viecha","234":"Okay. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","235":"Operator","236":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.","237":"Colin Rusch","238":"Yes, could you comment on whether you\u2019ll be better constrained at 100,000 vehicles a quarter in 2Q?","239":"Elon Musk","24":"Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Tesla\u2019s first quarter 2019 Q&A webcast. I am joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the updated letter we published at the same link as this webcast.","240":"Self-constrained you mean? We don\u2019t feel constrained at 400,000.","241":"Colin Rusch","242":"And then as you look at the Maxwell Technology integration, post close, how quickly do you think you\u2019ll be able to integrate that technology into the battery production? And could you comment on potential for chemistry and form factor changes as you get it integrated?","243":"Elon Musk","244":"I mean, you\u2019re really asking some pretty super secret sauce questions here. I think yes, we\u2019ll have I think we\u2019ll probably have an Investor Day like an Autonomy Day maybe later this year or early next just to go over the cell and battery technology and future strategy. And think that will be very informative but we do recognize the criticality of this.","245":"Colin Rusch","246":"Okay thank you so much guys.","247":"Operator","248":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","249":"Joseph Spak","25":"During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","250":"First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin that you\u2019re targeting. Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?","251":"Zachary Kirkhorn","252":"Yes, this is Zach here, that\u2019s [indiscernible] so we\u2019re targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. The biggest lever there is actually two components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there\u2019s just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us. But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we\u2019re executing on over the course of the year. And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we\u2019re seeing an increased take rate on our full Self-Driving offering. And there are, revenue associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there. And as that option becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more revenue on that. So all of these things together within our internal gives us [indiscernible].","253":"Elon Musk","254":"Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume, we\u2019re driving units of the Model 3 which is extremely efficient magnet motor and product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X. And so, we\u2019re actually able to get cost reduction while improving range and [indiscernible] of the car. That\u2019s just 1 example.","255":"Joseph Spak","256":"Okay. The second question is just looking at the 10-K, you\u2019ve notice $4.9 billion purchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1. And then Elon, in some of your communication, you\u2019ve indicated production constraints. I guess the question is, does that $4.9 billion correlate to reaching that 35 gigawatt hour rate? And if you can\u2019t hit that because of production constraints, does that adjust?","257":"Unidentified Company Speaker","258":"This is [indiscernible]. So, the purchase obligation in the 10-K is basically for the entire contract which we have for Panasonic. It\u2019s not something that we need to hit. I mean, make the purchases tomorrow. So this is going to take a couple of years.","259":"Joseph Spak","26":"Elon Musk","260":"Okay.","261":"Operator","262":"Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","263":"Colin Langan","264":"Great thanks for taking my question I mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a demand issue for some of the product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when there is a demand issue. So, what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?","265":"Elon Musk","266":"I mean, our goal, as we\u2019ve been very clear about from the beginning of the company, is to make our cars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important more people realizing in range and posher interior and Autopilot. So, we thought a product that\u2019s really just knows the sweet spot, which I think the $39,500 Model 3 is just really nail the sweet spot and raising consumer response accordingly. You can tell by the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn\u2019t have Autopilot and has a software introspection, that kind of thing. It\u2019s like slightly more inconvenience to buy just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So, it\u2019s just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something. But we see very few people actually take us up on that $35,000 offer, but it\u2019s there and will remain there.","267":"Colin Langan","268":"As a follow up, you\u2019re still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year. Are you still confident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that\u2019s getting pretty close to the point?","269":"Elon Musk","27":"Thanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.","270":"Yes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well. Tesla the execution of our team underground there. I get daily e-mails with Tesla picture from one day to next from Tom who leads the Gigafactory program. And so, we\u2019re obviously discussing or getting updates 7 days a week. So, I mean, I\u2019m in that Gigafactory e-mail. So, in terms of execution, of course, the production grows as fast as the [indiscernible] item. That\u2019s very important to bear in mind. So, we have 99% of things in good shape can make the car. So, with respect to that said, it looks like we\u2019ll reach volume production at the end of this year with, let\u2019s say, more than 1,000 cars a week, maybe 2,000 from Shanghai Giga at the end of this year. That\u2019s what it looks like to be the case right now. If it\u2019s not at the end, it will be shortly thereafter. And then we expect to have multiple sales flyers for Shanghai Giga.","271":"Martin Viecha","272":"Great. Thank you very much everyone. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for our Q&A today. Appreciate all of your questions, and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter.","273":"Operator","274":"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.","28":"We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving. We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving. We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps \u2013 yes. Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China. As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them. This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1. This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.","29":"So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles \u2013 vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time. The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter. This will make the \u2013 this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.","3":"Elon Musk - Chief Executive Officer","30":"In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost 60%. It\u2019s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago. There are literally \u2013 best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world. And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well. So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.","31":"Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car. They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3. And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains. So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is \u2013 and there are number of other small changes. If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free. So this is \u2013 yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.","32":"So, they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This would actually be at a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster and they were any headwind as well. So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California. I mean, I have never \u2013 back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception. And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way. And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.","33":"So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production levels. And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will fundamentally transform transport as we know it. The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version 3 on the energy side. And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the world. And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.","34":"Martin Viecha","35":"Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.","36":"Zachary Kirkhorn","37":"Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla\u2019s standards. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter. We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.","38":"First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows. The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1. We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.","39":"On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter. So, we are addressing this by regionally \u2013 by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two. The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. So, we don\u2019t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet. We expect significant cost savings to come from this.","4":"J.B. Straubel - Chief Technology Officer","40":"On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that\u2019s led through to net income. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28. This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes. There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.","41":"Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted. If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries. Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%. This is due to two factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1. In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.","42":"As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon\u2019s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup. From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world. So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that. And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for capital efficient expansion. In energy as well, as we have noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned investments in that.","43":"So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company and I am looking forward to the discussion.","44":"Martin Viecha","45":"Thank you very much, Zachary. Let\u2019s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com. So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies? What is holding that back?","46":"Elon Musk","47":"Jonathan, do you want to?","48":"Jonathan Chang","49":"Yes, hi, it\u2019s Jonathan Chang as our Counsel here. Right now, we are just going through approvals with the SEC. There is not a whole lot of things holding it back. We are on schedule, we are on track. Right now, we are looking to close in mid-May.","5":"Zachary Kirkhorn - Chief Financial Officer","50":"Elon Musk","51":"Great. Thanks.","52":"Martin Viecha","53":"Thank you. The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in order to further simplify the ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety of driving in Autopilot? The insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla ownership right now.","54":"Elon Musk","55":"The answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month. It will be much more compelling than anything else out there.","56":"Martin Viecha","57":"Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the company?","58":"Elon Musk","59":"Sure. The challenge really is battery cells scarcity. As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?","6":"Jonathan Chang - General Counsel","60":"J.B. Straubel","61":"Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.","62":"Elon Musk","63":"Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a \u2013 quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don\u2019t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It\u2019s much faster than an automotive. So over time, we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla\u2019s business over time. We also have \u2013 we are also finding a significant increase in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally refined the product offering to be something that\u2019s extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install. So, to radically streamline process from what has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of 20, 25 years and so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down by [indiscernible] which you can do accelerate aging on the roof and we want the installation process to be simple and easy, which is actually the Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the team and we are looking forward to scaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.","64":"Martin Viecha","65":"Thank you very much. The next question comes from Jeffrey, when and where will the Tesla semi production begin?","66":"Jerome Guillen","67":"This is Jerome. Next year we will start production. We are very happy with driving the trucks extensively with I think so far quite amazing success, yes.","68":"Elon Musk","69":"The prototypes are working amazingly well.","7":"Jerome Guillen \u2013 President, Automotive Division","70":"Jerome Guillen","71":"Yes, very well. We just used them all the time. We load them to maximum weight and continue to make improvements.","72":"Elon Musk","73":"So, we have even used them to deliver some Model 3s.","74":"Jerome Guillen","75":"Yes, that was fun. So, yes, we will start production next year. The location was not yet set, but it\u2019s pretty clear that we make all the batteries and driving it in Reno.","76":"Martin Viecha","77":"Great. Thank you very much.","78":"Elon Musk","79":"Sparks technically.","8":"Conference Call Participants","80":"Jerome Guillen","81":"Sparks, yes. Northern Nevada.","82":"Elon Musk","83":"Yes, Northern Nevada.","84":"Martin Viecha","85":"And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon should current owners that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?","86":"Elon Musk","87":"I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don\u2019t really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That\u2019s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware. So, just no need to rush to the \u2013 get your computer replaced. It\u2019s like 2 to 3 months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially. For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y. So, we don\u2019t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it\u2019s hardly a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.","88":"Martin Viecha","89":"Thank you very much. Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.","9":"Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","90":"Question-and-Answer Session","91":"Operator","92":"Thank you. Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","93":"Ryan Brinkman","94":"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second. Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or reservation list maybe telling you?","95":"Elon Musk","96":"Yes. We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3. The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade. So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant. And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don\u2019t like buying cars in winter and we are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December 31. So, these were all very positive factors. We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model 3. So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries. Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.","97":"Ryan Brinkman","98":"Okay, thanks. And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, because it was I think you said packed to the gills. I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada. Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?","99":"Elon Musk"}}
